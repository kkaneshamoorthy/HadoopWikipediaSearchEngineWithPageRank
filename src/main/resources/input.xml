'''Alexis Korner''' (19 April 1928 — 1 January 1984) was a [[blues]] [[musician]] and [[Presenter|radio broadcaster]], who has sometimes been referred to as &quot;a Founding Father of [[British Blues]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|iDE0dH6ZLwUC|Then, now and rare British beat 1960-1969 by Terry Rawlings|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major influence on the sound of the British music scene in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiorewind.co.uk/alexis_korner_page.htm  &quot;Korner, a pioneer and influential musician&quot; retrieved 26 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Korner was instrumental in bringing together various [[English people|English]] blues musicians.

==Early career==
'''Alexis Andrew Nicholas Koerner''' was born in [[Paris]] to an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Jew]]ish father and a half-[[Turkish people|Turkish]] half-[[Greeks|Greek]] mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=iTunes|title=Alexis Korner Biography|url=http://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/alexis-korner/id3194103|accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rolling Stone|title=Fricke's Picks: Free, Bluesman Alexis Korner, &quot;Scandinavia Action Jazz&quot;|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/frickes-picks-free-bluesman-alexis-korner-scandinavia-action-jazz-20061117|accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent his childhood in [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[North Africa]]. He arrived in [[London]] in 1940 at the start of [[World War II]]. One memory of his youth was listening to a record by black pianist [[Jimmy Yancey]] during a German [[Strategic bombing|air raid]]. Korner said, &quot;From then on all I wanted to do was play the blues.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tsxbpf&quot;&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p412/biography|pure_url=yes}} Bio at Allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he played [[piano]] and [[guitar]] (his first guitar was built by friend and author Sydney Hopkins, who wrote ''[[Mister God, This Is Anna]]''), and in 1949 joined [[Chris Barber]]'s Jazz Band&lt;ref&gt;[[John Pidgeon (Writer, radio producer)|John Pidgeon]]'s Rock'sbackpagesblog: http://www.rocksbackpagesblogs.com/2009/09/chris-barber-father-of-british-rb/&lt;/ref&gt; where he met blues harmonica player [[Cyril Davies]]. They started playing together as a duo, formed the influential London Blues and Barrelhouse Club in 1955, and made their first record together in 1957. Korner made his first official record on [[Decca Records]] DFE 6286 in the company of [[Ken Colyer]]'s [[Skiffle]] Group. His talent extended to playing [[mandolin]] on one of the tracks of this rare British [[Extended play|EP]], recorded in London on 28 July 1955. Korner brought many [[United States|American]] blues artists, previously unknown in Britain, to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|4y-oDmH2YzYC|The Beatles, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  by Allan F. Moore|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1960s==
{{Main|Blues Incorporated}}
In 1961, Korner and Davies formed [[Blues Incorporated]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Pidgeon (Writer, radio producer)|John Pidgeon]]'s Rock'sbackpages blog: http://www.rocksbackpagesblogs.com/2009/09/blues-incorporated-how-british-rb-trashed-trad&lt;/ref&gt; initially a loose-knit group of musicians with a shared love of [[electric blues]] and [[R&amp;B]] music. The group included, at various times, such influential musicians as [[Charlie Watts]], [[Jack Bruce]], [[Ginger Baker]], [[Long John Baldry]], [[Graham Bond]], [[Danny Thompson]] and [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]]. It also attracted a wider crowd of mostly younger fans, some of whom occasionally performed with the group, including [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Brian Jones]], [[Geoff Bradford (musician)|Geoff Bradford]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[John Mayall]] and [[Jimmy Page]].&lt;ref name=Shapiro1997&gt;{{cite book|last = Shapiro |first = Harry  |title = Alexis Korner: The Biography |year =1997|isbn = 0-7475-3163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One story is that [[the Rolling Stones]] went to stay at Korner's house late one night, in the early 1960s, after a performance. They entered in the accepted way, by climbing in through the kitchen window, to find [[Muddy Waters]]' band sleeping on the kitchen floor. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Although Cyril Davies left the group in late-1962, Blues Incorporated continued to record, with Korner at the helm, until 1966. However, by that time its originally stellar line-up (and crowd of followers) had mostly left to start their own bands. &quot;While his one-time acolytes the Rolling Stones and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] made the front pages of music magazines all over the world, Korner was relegated to the role of 'elder statesman'.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;tsxbpf&quot;/&gt;

Although he himself was a blues purist, Korner criticised better-known British blues musicians during the blues boom of the late 1960s for their blind adherence to [[Chicago blues]], as if the music came in no other form. He liked to surround himself with [[jazz]] musicians and often performed with a [[horn section]] drawn from a pool that included, among others, [[saxophone]] players [[Art Themen]], [[Mel Collins]], Dick Heckstall-Smith, [[Lol Coxhill]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://reocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palladium/9932/chodg_s.htm &quot;COLIN HODGKINSON sessions&quot;retrieved 29 August 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Morrissey]], [[John Surman]] and [[trombonist]] [[Mike Zwerin]].

== Broadcasting ==

In the 1960s Korner began a media career, working initially as a [[show business]] interviewer and then on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''Five O'Clock Club'', a children's TV show. Korner also wrote about blues for the music papers, and continued to maintain his own career as a blues artist, especially in Europe. 

On 17 October 1967, Korner interviewed [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] for the [[BBC]] radio show''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]''. Some of these tracks, including audio of Korner himself, appear on the Hendrix double-CD ''[[BBC Sessions (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|BBC Sessions]]'', including Korner playing slide guitar on &quot;[[(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man]]&quot;.

While touring [[Scandinavia]] he first joined forces with guitarist and singer [[Peter Thorup]], together forming the band New Church, who were one of the support bands at the [[Stones in the Park|Rolling Stones Free Concert]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[London]], on 5 July 1969. [[Jimmy Page]] reportedly found out about a new singer, [[Robert Plant]], who had been jamming with Korner, who wondered why Plant had not yet been discovered. Plant and Korner were in the process of recording a full album with Plant on vocals until Page had asked him to join &quot;the New [[Yardbirds]]&quot;, aka [[Led Zeppelin]]. Only two songs are in circulation from these recordings: &quot;Steal Away&quot; and &quot;Operator&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro1997&quot;/&gt; Alexis Korner gave one of his last radio interviews to BBC Midlands on the ''Record Collectors Show'' with Mike Adams and the Late Chris Savory.

===1970s===
{{Main|C. C. S. (pop group)}}
[[Image:Alexis Korner 1968 Bremen.jpg|thumb|160px|Korner and [[Peter Thorup]] in [[Bremen]]]]
In 1970 Korner and Thorup formed a big-band ensemble, [[C. C. S. (pop group)|C.C.S.]] - short for &quot;The Collective Consciousness Society&quot; - which had several hit singles produced by [[Mickie Most]], including a version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot;, which was used as the theme for BBC's ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'' between 1971 and 1981. Another instrumental called &quot;Brother&quot; was used as the theme to the [[BBC Radio 1]] Top 20/40 when [[Tom Browne (broadcaster and actor)|Tom Browne]]/[[Simon Bates]] presented the programme in the 1970s. It was also used in the 1990s on Radio Luxembourg for the Top 20 Singles chart and was hosted by [[Shaun Tilley]].  This was the period of Korner's greatest commercial success in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro1997&quot;/&gt;

===1970s to 1984===
[[Image:Alexis Korner musician.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Korner with Blues Incorporated]]
In 1973, he formed another group, Snape, with [[Boz Burrell]], Mel Collins, and [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]], who were previously together in [[King Crimson]]. Korner also played on [[B.B. King]]'s ''In London'' album, and cut his own, similar &quot;supersession&quot; album; ''Get Off My Cloud'', with [[Keith Richards]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Nicky Hopkins]] and members of [[Joe Cocker]]'s [[The Grease Band|Grease Band]]. In the mid-1970s, while touring [[Germany]], Korner established an intensive working relationship with bassist [[Colin Hodgkinson]] who played for the support act [[Back Door (jazz trio)|Back Door]]. They would continue to collaborate right up until Korner's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro1997&quot;/&gt;

In the 1970s Korner's main career was in broadcasting. In 1973 he presented a unique 6-part documentary on [[BBC Radio 1]], ''The Rolling Stones Story'',&lt;ref name = &quot;ibndjr&quot;&gt;[http://radiorewind.co.uk/alexis_korner_page.htm Radiorewind.co.uk -  retrieved 26 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977 he established a Sunday-night blues and soul show on Radio 1, ''Alexis Korner's Blues and Soul Show'', which ran until 1981. He also used his gravelly voice to great effect as an advertising voice-over artist. In 1978, for Korner's 50th birthday, an all-star concert was held featuring many of his above-mentioned friends, as well as [[Eric Clapton]], [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], [[Chris Farlowe]], [[Zoot Money]] and others, which was later released as ''[[The Party Album (Alexis Korner album)|The Party Album]]'', and as a video.

In 1981, Korner joined another &quot;supergroup&quot;, [[Rocket 88 (band)|Rocket 88]], a project led by [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] based on [[boogie-woogie]] [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] players, which featured a [[rhythm section]] comprising [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Charlie Watts]], among others, as well as a [[horn section]]. They toured Europe and released an album on [[Atlantic Records]]. He played in [[Italy]] with [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]] and the Blues Society of Italian bluesman Guido Toffoletti.

[[File:StuG-III-latrun-2.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[StuG III]] with 75 mm gun, first in service for the Syrian army, now in an Israeli museum.]]
An '''assault gun''' is a [[gun]] or [[howitzer]] mounted on a motor vehicle or [[armoured warfare|armored]] [[chassis]], designed for use in the [[direct fire]] role in support of [[infantry]] when attacking other [[infantry]] or [[fortified]] positions. The term is a literal translation of the German word &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot;. Germany introduced the first purpose-built assault gun, the Stug III, in the late 1930s thus establishing this category of armoured vehicles.

Historically the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the [[gun]] or [[howitzer]] in a fully enclosed [[casemate]] on a [[tank]] [[chassis]]. The use of a [[casemate]] instead of a [[gun turret]] limited these weapons [[field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]], but allowed a larger gun to be fitted relative to the chassis, more armor to be fitted for the same weight, and provided a cheaper construction. In most cases, these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.

==History==

===World War II===

[[Image:Su76 nn.jpg|thumb|The Soviet [[SU-76]] was easily constructed in small factories incapable of producing proper tanks.]]

Assault guns were primarily used during [[World War II]] by the forces of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Early in the war, the [[Germans]] began to create makeshift assault guns by mounting their [[infantry support weapon]]s on the bed of a [[truck]] or on obsolete [[tank]]s with the turret removed. Later in the war, both the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] introduced fully [[armoured warfare|armored]] purpose-built assault guns into their arsenals.

Early on, the Soviets built the [[KV-2]], a variant of the [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] heavy tank with a short-barreled [[152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20)|152 mm howitzer]] mounted in an oversized turret. This was not a success in battle, and was replaced with a very successful series of increasingly powerful turretless assault guns: the [[SU-76]], [[SU-122]], and the heavy [[SU-152]], which were followed by the [[ISU-122]] and [[ISU-152]] on the new [[Iosif Stalin tank|IS]] heavy tank [[chassis]].

[[Image:Germany06 086.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sturmtiger]] in the [[Deutsches Panzermuseum]] at [[Munster, Lower Saxony|Munster]].]]

The primary German assault gun was the [[Sturmgeschütz III]] (StuG III). Late production StuG III variants, armed with a high-velocity dual-purpose [[7.5 cm KwK 40|75mm gun]] blurred the line between assault guns and [[tank destroyer]]s and was the Wehrmacht's most-produced armored fighting vehicle, at some 9,400 examples. The Germans also built a number of other fully armored turretless assault guns, including the [[StuG IV]], [[Brummbär]] and [[Sturmtiger]]. The latter two were very heavy vehicles and were built only in small quantities.

[[Battalions]] of assault guns, usually StuG IIIs, commonly replaced the intended [[panzer]] battalion in the German [[Panzergrenadier|panzergrenadier divisions]] due to the chronic shortage of tanks, and were sometimes used as makeshifts even in the [[panzer division]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Jentz (1996): Panzertruppen:
The Complete Guide to the Creation &amp; Combat Employment of Germany's Tank Force, vol.2, 1943-1945, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Independent battalions were also deployed as 'stiffeners' for [[infantry]] divisions, and the StuG III's [[anti-tank]] capabilities contributed greatly to the German's ability to draw out [[World War II]] after they had lost the strategic initiative.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} However, command problems ensued, as the assault guns were considered to be [[artillery]] by the [[Wehrmacht]] and therefore the assault guns were not under the control of the Panzer unit's commanding officer, reducing unit effectiveness.{{Clarify|Independent Sturmgeschütz Abteilungen indeed were part of the artillery arm, but in Panzer- and Panzergrenadier divisions StuGs served in so called 'Panzer-Sturmgeschütz Abteilungen', i.e. 'tank battalions equipped with assault guns', under the [[Panzerwaffe]].|date=December 2012}}
[[Image:Sherman Tank WW2.jpg|right|thumb|A preserved Sherman M4(105).]]
[[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] forces also deployed vehicles designed for a close support role, but these were conventional tanks whose only significant modification was the replacement of the main gun with a howitzer. Among these was the M4(105), a [[M4 Sherman]] tank armed with a [[M101 howitzer|M4 105 mm howitzer]]. In addition, the Mark IV version of the [[Cromwell tank|Centaur tank]] and the Mark V and the Mark VIII versions of the [[Churchill tank]] were fitted with [[Ordnance QF 95 mm Howitzer|95&amp;nbsp;mm howitzers]]. As the amount of German armour encountered by the Allies decreased, especially in Italy, a number of American [[tank destroyer]] units were used in the assault gun role for infantry support.

The AVRE version of the Churchill Tank was armed with a [[Mortar (weapon)#Spigot mortar|Spigot mortar]] that fired a {{convert|40|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[High explosive|HE]]-filled projectile (nicknamed the ''Flying Dustbin'') {{convert|150|yd|m}}. Its task was to attack fortified positions such as [[bunker]]s at close range (see [[Hobart's Funnies]]).

=== Postwar use ===

In the post-[[World War II|WWII]] era, vehicles fitting into an &quot;assault gun&quot; category were developed as a light-weight, air-deployable, direct fire weapon for use with airborne troops. Current weapons were either based on [[jeep]]s or small [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] vehicles and the airborne troops thus always fought at a distinct disadvantage in terms of heavy weapons. The Soviet Union and the United States were the most attracted to the idea of providing this capability to traditionally light airborne forces. Their answers to the problem were similar, with the United States developing the [[M56 Scorpion]] and the Soviet Union developing the [[ASU-57]], both essentially air-droppable light anti-tank guns.

The Soviets went on to develop an improved air-droppable assault gun, the [[ASU-85]], which served through the 1980s, while their [[SU-100]] remained in service with Communist countries, including Vietnam and Cuba, years after WW2. The US M56 and another similar vehicle, the [[Ontos|M50 Ontos]], were to be the last of the more traditional assault guns in US service. Improvised arrangements such as [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier#Weapons|M113]] personnel carriers with recoilless rifles were quickly replaced by missile carrier vehicles in the anti-tank role.

The only vehicle with the qualities of an assault gun to be fielded after the removal of the M50 and M56 from service within the US military was the [[M551 Sheridan]]. The Sheridan's gun was a low-velocity weapon suitable in the assault role, but with the addition of the [[Shillelagh missile]] could double in the anti-tank role as well. It is important, however, to remember that the Sheridan was not developed as an assault gun, but as a light reconnaissance vehicle.

Currently there appears to be a move toward wheeled vehicles fitting a &quot;tank destroyer&quot; or &quot;assault gun&quot; role, with the US testing the [[Mobile Gun System|M1128 Stryker MGS]]. The [[Centauro]] Wheeled Tank Destroyer of the [[Italian Army|Italian]] and [[Spanish Army|Spanish Armies]], the Chinese anti-tank gun PTL-02 and the French [[AMX 10 RC]] heavy armored car are also good examples. While these vehicles might be useful in a direct fire role, none were developed with this specifically in mind, reminiscent of the use of tank destroyers by the US military in the assault gun role during WWII.

[[File:Tank destroyers.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Two American M10 tank destroyers in France during World War II.]]
A '''tank destroyer''' is a type of [[armored fighting vehicle]] armed with a [[Tank gun|gun]] or missile launcher, and is designed specifically to engage [[tank|enemy armored vehicles]]. Tanks are generally [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s designed for [[front-line]] combat which combines [[operational mobility]] and [[Military tactics|tactical]] [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] and [[defense (military)|defensive]] capabilities and perform all primary tasks of the armoured troops on the [[battle]]field; the tank destroyer on the other hand is specifically designed mainly for taking on enemy armour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tank#CITEREFvon Senger und Etterlin1960|von Senger and Etterlin (1960)]], ''The World's Armored Fighting Vehicles'', p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Many have been based on a [[Continuous track|tracked]] tank [[chassis]], while others are wheeled.

Since [[World War II]], gun-armed tank destroyers have fallen out of favor as armies have favored multirole [[main battle tank]]s. However, lightly armored [[Anti-tank missile|anti tank guided missile]] (ATGM) carriers are commonly used for supplementary long-range anti-tank work. The resurgence of expeditionary warfare in the past twenty years has seen the emergence of gun-armed wheeled vehicles, sometimes called protected gun systems, which may bear a superficial resemblance to tank destroyers, but are employed as direct fire support units typically providing support in low-intensity operations such as the wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].

== World War II ==
Dedicated anti-tank vehicles made their first major appearance in the Second World War as combatants developed effective armored vehicles and tactics.  Some were little more than stopgap solutions, mounting an [[anti-tank gun]] on a tracked vehicle to give mobility, while others were more sophisticated designs.  An example of the development of tank destroyer technology throughout the war are the [[Marder III]] and [[Hetzer]] vehicle, that were very different in spite of being based on the same chassis: Marder was straightforwardly an anti-tank gun on tracks whereas Hetzer traded some firepower (its [[7.5 cm PaK 39|Pak 39]], designed to operate within the confines of a fully armored fighting compartment, fires the same projectiles from a reduced propellant charge compared to Marder's [[7.5 cm Pak 40|Pak 40]]) for better armor protection and ease of  concealment on the battlefield.

Except for most American designs, tank destroyers were all turretless and had fixed or [[casemate]] superstructures. When a tank destroyer was used against enemy tanks from a defensive position such as by ambush, the common lack of a rotating turret was not particularly critical while the lower silhouette was highly desirable. The turretless design allowed accommodation of a more powerful gun, typically a dedicated anti-tank gun (in lieu of a regular tank's general purpose [[tank gun|main gun]] that fired both anti-tank and high explosive ammunition) that had a longer barrel than could be mounted in a turreted tank on the same chassis. The lack of a turret also increased the vehicle's internal volume, allowing for increased ammunition stowage and crew comfort.&lt;ref&gt;([[#References|Perrett 1987:84]])&lt;/ref&gt; Eliminating the turret also allowed the vehicle to carry thicker armor than would otherwise be the case, and also allowed this armour to be concentrated in the hull. Sometimes there was no armored roof (only a weather cover) to keep the overall weight down to the limit that the chassis could bear. The absence of a turret also meant that tank destroyers could be manufactured significantly cheaper, faster and more easily than the tanks on which they were based and found particular favor when production resources were lacking. After hard lessons early in the war, machine guns were mounted for use against infantry but the limited traverse of the mounting meant that they were still less effective than those used on turreted tanks.

===Polish===
Variants of the Polish [[TKS]] and [[TK-3]] tankettes up-armed with 20&amp;nbsp;mm gun (23–26 vehicles) were operationally deployed in the [[invasion of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Jońca, R. Szubański, J. Tarczyński, Wrzesień 1939 Pojazdy Wojska Polskiego, Wyd. WKiŁ, Warszawa 1990, s. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There were also 37&amp;nbsp;mm armed [[TKS-D]] (2 experimental vehicles) or 45&amp;nbsp;mm armed [[TKD]] (4 experimental vehicles). It is not sure whether they were used operationally at all.&lt;/ref&gt; They were used as an anti-tank component of the reconnaissance units.

===German===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-782-0041-31, Nordafrika, Panzerjäger 1.jpg|thumb|''Panzerjäger'' I]]

The first [[Nazi Germany|German]] tank destroyers were the ''[[Panzerjäger]]'' (&quot;tank hunters&quot;) which took an existing anti-tank gun and mounted it on a convenient chassis to give mobility, usually with just a three-sided [[gun shield]] for crew protection. For instance, 202 obsolete [[Panzer I]] light tanks were modified by removing the turret and were rebuilt as the [[Panzerjäger I]] self-propelled [[Škoda Works|Skoda]] {{nowrap|47 mm}} anti-tank gun. Similarly, [[Panzer II]] tanks were used on the eastern front. Captured Soviet {{nowrap|76.2 mm}} anti-tank guns were mounted on modified Panzer II chassis, producing the [[Marder II]] self-propelled anti-tank gun. The most common mounting was a German {{nowrap|75 mm}} anti-tank gun on the Czech [[Panzer 38(t)]] chassis to produce the [[Marder III]]. The Panzer 38(t) chassis was also used to make the Jagdpanzer 38 '[[Hetzer]]' casemate style tank destroyer. The Panzerjäger series continued up to the {{nowrap|88 mm}} equipped [[Nashorn]].

[[File:StuG-III-latrun-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Sturmgeschütz'' III]]

German tank destroyers based on the [[Panzer III]] and later German tanks were unique in that they had more armor than their tank counterparts.  One of the more successful German tank destroyers was actually designed as a self-propelled artillery gun, the [[Sturmgeschütz III]].  Based on the Panzer III tank chassis, the Sturmgeschütz III was originally fitted with a low-velocity gun, and was assigned to the artillery arm for infantry fire support.  Later, after encountering Soviet tanks, it was refitted with a comparatively short-barreled high-velocity anti-tank gun, usually with a [[muzzle brake]], enabling it to function as a tank destroyer.  The ''Sturmgeschütz III'' from its 1938 origin used a new casemate-style superstructure with an integrated design similar to the later ''[[Jagdpanzer]]'' to completely enclose the crew.  It was employed in infantry support and offensive armored operations as well as in the defensive anti-tank role. The StuG III was the most-produced German armored fighting vehicle of any type built during the war years, with some 9,400 examples built from January 1940 through March 1945.

[[File:Jagdpanther2.jpg|thumb|right|''Jagdpanther'']]

Although the early German ''Panzerjäger'' carried more effective weapons than the tanks on which they were based, they were generally lacking in protection for the crew, having thinly armored open-topped superstructures. The &quot;open-topped&quot; design format of the ''Panzerjäger'' vehicles was succeeded by the ''Jagdpanzer'' '(&quot;hunting tanks&quot;) which mounted the gun in true casemate-style superstructures, completely enclosing the crew compartment in armor that would usually be integral to the hull.  The first of these ''Jagdpanzer''s was the ''Ferdinand'' (later renamed the ''[[Elefant]]''), a 70-ton monster built from the already-built quantity of ninety-one Porsche VK4501{P)-based [[Tiger I#Design history|Tiger I]] losing contract contender's hulls and drive systems, mounting a long-barreled [[8.8 cm Pak 43|88&amp;nbsp;mm]] cannon in an added casemate, more like the earlier ''Panzerjägers'' had with their added-on armor shielding for the guncrew, but in the ''Elefant'' completely enclosing the gun and firing crew in the added casemate, as the later purpose-built ''Jagdpanzers'' would.  However, the ''Elefant'' proved to be mechanically unreliable and difficult to maneuver, and once all ninety-one unturreted &quot;Porsche Tiger&quot; hulls/drive systems were converted, no more were built.  The German Army had more success with the [[Jagdpanther]].  Introduced in mid-1944, the Jagdpanther was considered the best of the casemate-design Jagdpanzer designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks&quot;&gt;Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  It featured the same powerful PaK 43 88mm cannon used on the unwieldy ''Elefant'', now fitted to the chassis of the medium [[Panther tank]], providing greatly improved armor-penetrating capability in a medium-weight vehicle.

[[File:Jagdtiger 1 Bovington.jpg|thumb|left|''Jagdtiger'']]
Facing an increasingly defensive war, the German Army turned to larger and more powerfully armed Jagdpanzer designs, and in July 1944 the first ''[[Jagdtiger]]'' rolled off the production line; the heaviest German armored fighting vehicle to go into active service.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks&quot;/&gt;  The ''Jagdtiger'' featured a huge [[12.8 cm Pak 44|128&amp;nbsp;mm PaK 44]] cannon and heavy armor protection.  Only 88 ''Jagdtiger'' vehicles were produced, barely matching the total number of the earlier Ferdinand/Elefant vehicles. They were first deployed to combat units in September 1944.

The decision of German armored vehicle designers to use a casemate-stye superstructure for all tank destroyers had the advantage of a reduced silhouette, allowing the crew to more frequently fire from defilade ambush positions.  Such designs were also easier and faster to manufacture and offered good crew protection from artillery fire and shell splinters.  However, the lack of a rotating turret limited the gun's traverse to a few degrees. This meant that the entire tank normally had to be turned onto its target by the driver, a much slower process than simply rotating a powered turret.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, John P. ''Another River, Another Town'', New York: Random House Publishers (2002), pp. 61–61&lt;/ref&gt;  If the vehicle became immobilized due to engine failure or track damage, it could not rotate its gun to counter opposing tanks, making it highly vulnerable to counterfire.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, pp. 61–61&lt;/ref&gt;  This vulnerability was later exploited by opposing tank forces. Even the largest and most powerful of German tank destroyers were found abandoned on the field after a battle, having been immobilized by one or more hits by high explosive (HE) or armor-piercing (AP) shells to the track or front drive sprocket.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, pp. 61–62: Even the U.S. M4 Sherman could disable a Jagdpanther's track or fracture the front drive sprocket with a 75&amp;nbsp;mm HE shell.  As the crew abandoned their vehicle, they were easy targets for enemy machinegun fire.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet===
[[Image:ISU-122 skos RB.jpg|thumb|Soviet [[ISU-122]], a [[casemate]] tank destroyer of the Second World War, shown here with postwar [[Polish Army]] markings]]
{{Main|Samokhodnaya ustanovka}}
As with the Germans, most of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] designs mounted anti-tank guns, with limited traverse in casemate-style turretless hulls, in a general design format looking much like the Germans' own ''Jagdpanzer'' vehicles. The results were smaller, lighter, and simpler to build than tanks, but could carry larger guns. The Soviets produced the {{nowrap|85 mm}} [[SU-85]] and {{nowrap|100 mm}} [[SU-100]] self-propelled guns based on the same chassis as the [[T-34]] medium tank, as well as the {{nowrap|122 mm}} [[ISU-122]] and {{nowrap|152 mm}} [[ISU-152]] which shared components with the [[IS-2]] heavy tank and was nicknamed ''Zveroboy'' (&quot;beast killer&quot;) for its ability to destroy German [[Tiger I tank|Tigers]], [[Panther tank|Panthers]] and [[Elefant]]s. The predecessor of the ISU 152 was the SU 152, built on the KV1S chassis and shared many similarities (incl. its gun) with the ISU 152. The ISU-152 built as a heavy assault gun, relied on the weight of the shell fired from its M-1937/43 howitzer to defeat tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks2&quot;&gt;Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the Soviets also shifted all production of light tanks like the [[T-70]] to much simpler and better-armed [[SU-76]] self-propelled guns, which used the same drive train. The SU-76 was originally designed as an anti-tank vehicle, but was soon relegated to the infantry-support role.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks3&quot;&gt;Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Tank destroyer battalion (United States)}}
[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and counterpart [[United Kingdom|British]] designs were very different in conception. U.S. doctrine was based, in light of the [[fall of France]], on the perceived need to defeat German [[blitzkrieg]] tactics, and U.S. units expected to be faced with large numbers of German tanks attacking on relatively narrow fronts. These were ''expected'' to break through a thin screen of anti-tank guns, hence the decision that the main anti-tank units – the [[Tank destroyer battalion (United States)|Tank Destroyer (TD) battalions]] – should be concentrated and very mobile. In actual practice, such German attacks rarely happened; throughout the war only one battalion ever fought in an engagement quite like that which had originally been envisaged (the [[601st Tank Destroyer Battalion|601st]], at the [[Battle of El Guettar]]). The Tank Destroyer Command eventually numbered over 100,000 men and 80 battalions each equipped with 36 self-propelled tank destroyers or towed guns. In part because of the effectiveness of US TD tactics, no German campaign against the US ever achieved its objectives, nor did any{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} TD unit lose more vehicles than its German opponent.

[[File:Aberdean proving grounds 036.JPG|thumb|3in Gun Motor Carriage M10]]
Only a few shots were expected to be fired from any firing position. Strong reconnaissance elements were provided so that TDs would be able to use pre-arranged firing positions to best advantage. [[Flanking fire]] by TDs was emphasized, both to penetrate thinner enemy side armor, and to reduce the likelihood of accurate enemy return fire.

All American tank destroyers were officially known by exactly the same collective term used for American self-propelled artillery ordnance, &quot;Gun Motor Carriage&quot;. The designs were intended to be very mobile and heavily armed. Most retained a turret, but left it open on top both to save weight and to accommodate a larger gun. The earliest expedient design was an [[M3 Half-track]] mounting an M1897 {{nowrap|75 mm}} gun in a limited-traverse mount, and called the [[M3 GMC|75 mm Gun Motor Carriage M3]]. Another, considerably less successful, early design mounted a 37-mm anti-tank gun in the bed of a Dodge 3/4-ton truck - the [[M6 Fargo|37-mm GMC M6]]. By far the most common US design was the [[M10 Tank Destroyer|3in Gun Motor Carriage M10 (Wolverine)]], later supplemented by the [[M36 tank destroyer|90&amp;nbsp;mm Gun Motor Carriage M36 (Jackson)]] - both based on the [[M4 Sherman]] hull and powertrain - and the [[M18 Hellcat|76&amp;nbsp;mm Gun Motor Carriage M18 (Hellcat)]], based on a unique hull and powertrain design, with a slight visual resemblance to what was used for the later [[M24 Chaffee]] light tank. The M18 came closest to the US ideal; the vehicle was very fast, small, and mounted a {{nowrap|76 mm}} gun in a roofless open turret. The M36 Jackson GMC possessed the only American-origin operational gun that could rival [[8.8 cm Pak 43|the vaunted 88&amp;nbsp;mm]] German ordnance, the [[90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3|90 mm M3 gun]], and the M36 remained in service well after World War II.  The only dedicated American-origin, casemate hull design fighting vehicle of any type to be built during the war, that resembled the German and Soviet tank destroyers in hull and general gun mounting design, was the experimental [[T28 Super Heavy Tank]], which mounted a 105&amp;nbsp;mm T5E1 long-barrel cannon, which had a maximum firing range of 12 miles (20&amp;nbsp;km), and was originally designed as a self-propelled assault gun to breach Germany's [[Siegfried Line]] defenses.

Of these tank destroyers, only the {{nowrap|90 mm}} gun of the M36 proved to be effective against the frontal armor of Germans' larger armored vehicles at long range.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks3&quot;&gt;Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The open top and light armor made these tank destroyers vulnerable to anything greater than small-arms fire. As the number of German tanks encountered by American forces steadily decreased throughout the war, most battalions were split up and assigned to infantry units as supporting arms, fighting as [[assault guns]] or being used essentially as tanks.

===British===
British tanks in the early years of the war, both infantry and cruiser, were (with the exception of the pre-war Matilda I design), equipped with a gun intended to and capable of use against enemy tanks - the 40&amp;nbsp;mm [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder]]. This was replaced with the 57&amp;nbsp;mm [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder]] when that became available. There was extra impetus given to the development of anti-tank weaponry, which culminated in the 76mm [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder]], widely considered one of the best anti-tank guns of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks4&quot;&gt;Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Towed anti-tank guns were the domain of the [[Royal Artillery]] rather than the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and vehicles adapted to mount artillery including anti-tank self-propelled guns such as the [[Deacon (artillery)|Deacon]] (6pdr on an armoured wheeled truck chassis) and [[Archer (tank destroyer)|Archer]] (17pdr on tracked chassis) were their preserve as were US-supplied vehicles.

[[File:Archer SP 17 pdr Tank Destroyer.jpg|thumb|Archer. The gun faced to the rear]]
The self-propelled guns that were built in the &quot;tank destroyer&quot; mold came about through the desire to field the formidable [[QF 17 pounder]] anti-tank gun and simultaneous lack of suitable tanks to carry it. As a result they were of a somewhat extemporized nature. Mounting the gun on the [[Valentine tank]] chassis in a fixed superstructure gave the [[Archer (tank destroyer)|Archer]]. The 17 pounder was also used to re-equip the US-supplied [[M10 Tank Destroyer]], replacing the American 3&quot; gun to produce the [[17pdr SP Achilles]].

While there was a general move to a general purpose gun that was usable against both tanks and in supporting infantry, there was a need to put the 17 pdr into a tank for use against the enemy's heavy tanks. The [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger]] was a project to bring a 17 pdr tank into use to support the [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell cruiser tank]]. Delays led to it being outnumbered in use by the [[Sherman Firefly]] but a derivative of Challenger was the more-or-less open-topped variant ''Avenger'' which was delayed until post war before entering service. A cut-down 17 pdr - the 77mmHV was used to equip the [[Comet tank]] in the last year of the war.

The closest the British came to developing an armored tank destroyer in the vein of the German Jagdpanzers or Soviet ISU series was the Churchill {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} Gun Carrier {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} - a [[Churchill tank]] chassis with a boxy superstructure in place of the turret and mounting a {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} anti-aircraft gun. Although a number were ordered, they were not put into service. The design was rejected in favor of developing a 17 pounder armed Cromwell tank variant ultimately leading to the [[Comet tank]]. The heavy assault tank known as [[Tortoise (tank)|Tortoise]] intended for use in breaking through fixed defensive lines was well armoured and had a very powerful 32 pounder gun but did not reach service use.

By 1944, a number of the [[Sherman tank|Shermans]] in British use were being converted to [[Sherman Fireflies]] by adding the QF 17 pounder gun. Initially this gave each troop (platoon) of Shermans one powerfully armed tank. By war's end - through the production of more Fireflies and the replacement of Shermans by British tanks - about 50% of Shermans in British service were Fireflies.

==Post-World War II==
In the face of the Warsaw Pact, a general need for extra firepower was identified. In the 1950s, the UK produced the [[FV 4101 Charioteer]] to beef up the tank regiments, mounting a 20 pounder gun in an oversize turret on the Cromwell tank hull—it lacked the all round capability of the [[Centurion tank]]. In the late 1960s, Germany developed the [[Kanonenjagdpanzer]], essentially a modernized World War II Jagdpanzer mounting a {{nowrap|90 mm}} gun. As Soviet designs became more heavily armored, the {{nowrap|90 mm}} gun became ineffective and the Kanonenjagdpanzers were retrofitted for different roles or retired. Some provisions were made for the fitting of a 105&amp;nbsp;mm cannon, and many of the vehicles were modified to fire [[Euromissile HOT|HOT]] or [[TOW missile]]s in place of a main gun. These upgraded variants remained in service into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;([[#References|Gelbart 1996:137-8]])&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of flexible [[anti-tank missile]]s, which were capable of installation on almost any vehicle in the 1960s, the concept of the tank destroyer has morphed into light vehicles with missiles. With the weight of main battle tanks growing to the forty to seventy-tonne range, airborne forces were unable to deploy reasonable anti-tank forces. The result was a number of attempts to make a light vehicle, including the conventional [[ASU-85]], the recoilless rifle-armed [[Ontos]], and missile-armed [[Malkara missile#FV1620 Humber Hornet|Hornet Malkara]] armored car and [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan]] light assault vehicle.

==Modern==
Many forces' [[IFV]]s carry [[anti-tank missile]]s in every infantry platoon, and [[attack helicopter]]s have also added anti-tank capability to the modern battlefield. But there are still dedicated anti-tank vehicles with very heavy long-range missiles, and ones intended for [[Airborne forces|airborne]] use.

[[Image:NM142 x 3.jpg|thumb|A Norwegian anti-tank platoon equipped with [[NM142]] TOW missile launchers]]
There have also been dedicated anti-tank vehicles built on ordinary [[armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carrier]] or [[armored car (military)|armored car]] chassis. Examples include the U.S. [[M901 ITV|M901 ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle)]] and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[NM142]], both on an [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] chassis, several [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] ATGM launchers based on the [[BRDM]] reconnaissance car, the British [[FV438 Swingfire]] and [[FV102 Striker]] and the [[Germany|German]] [[Raketenjagdpanzer]] series built on the chassis of the [[HS 30]] and [[Marder (IFV)|Marder]] IFV.

A [[United States Army|US Army]] combined arms battalion has two infantry companies with TOW missile-armed [[M2 Bradley|Bradley IFVs]] and can bring a large concentration of accurate and lethal fire to bear on an attacking enemy unit that uses AFVs. They can be complemented by mobile units of AH-64 Apache Helicopters armed with TOW or Hellfire antitank missiles.

[[Image:Pzj Tow PIRANHA - Schweizer Armee - Steel Parade 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Mowag Piranha]]-based, [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-armed ATGM carrier of the [[Swiss Army]]]]
Missile carrying vehicles however are referred to as [[anti-tank missile]] carriers instead of tank destroyers.

Some gun-armed tank destroyers continue to be used. The [[People's Republic of China]] has developed the tracked [[Type 89 (Tank Destroyer)|PTZ89]] and the wheeled [[PTL02]] tank destroyers. PTZ89 is armed with a {{nowrap|120 mm}} smoothbore cannon while PTL02, developed by NORINCO for the PLA's new light (rapid reaction) mechanized infantry divisions, carries a {{nowrap|100 mm}} one (a version armed with a 105&amp;nbsp;mm rifled gun is available for export). PTL02 is built on the 6×6 wheeled chassis of the [[WZ551]] APC.

[[Italy]] and [[Spain]] use the Italian-built [[Centauro]], a wheeled tank destroyer with a {{nowrap|105 mm}} cannon. The gun-armed tank destroyer may possibly see revival in the US Army through the introduction of the [[Stryker]], more specifically, the [[Mobile Gun System|M1128 Mobile Gun System]], a Stryker variant armed with a {{nowrap|105 mm}} cannon which has remote control and autoloading capabilities. Originally, the Canadian Forces had considered replacing their aging [[Leopard 1]] tanks with the Stryker Mobile Gun System. But with the increased use of [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] capable of destroying Strykers by insurgent forces, they opted instead to purchase the [[Leopard 2]] tank.

A military '''armored''' (or '''armoured''') '''car''' is a wheeled [[vehicle armour|light armored vehicle]], lighter than other [[armoured fighting vehicle|armored fighting vehicle]]s, primarily being armored and/or armed for self-defense of the occupants. Other multi-axled wheeled military vehicles can be quite large, and actually be superior to some smaller tracked vehicles in terms of armor and armament.

==History==
[[File:Charron Girardot Voigt 1902.jpg|thumb|French armored car: the [[Charron-Girardot-Voigt 1902]].]]

The armed car was invented by [[Royal Page Davidson]] at [[Northwestern Military and Naval Academy]] in 1898 with the [[Davidson-Duryea gun carriage]] and the later [[Davidson Automobile Battery armored car]]. These were not 'armored cars' in the sense implied by the modern term, as they provided no real protection for their crews against any kind of opposing fire. They were also, by virtue of their small capacity engines, far less efficient than the cavalry and horse-drawn guns that they were intended to complement.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a number of military armored vehicles were manufactured by adding armor and weapons to existing vehicles. The first fully armored one was the &quot;[[Motor War Car]]&quot; designed by [[Vickers]] in [[England]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== World War I ===
Generally, the armored cars were used by more or less independent car commanders. However, sometimes they were used in larger units up to squadron size. The cars were primarily armed with light machine guns. But larger units usually employed a few cars with heavier guns. As air power became a factor, armored cars offered a mobile platform for anti-aircraft guns.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, ''Encyclopedia of Armored Cars'', pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rolls Royce 1920 Mk1 1 Bovington.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]] 1920 pattern]]&lt;!-- The spelling &quot;Armoured Car&quot; is a proper noun here: do not change. --&gt;
The first effective use of an armored vehicle in combat was achieved by the [[Belgian Army]] in August–September 1914. They had placed [[John Cockerill (company)|Cockerill]] armour plating and a [[Hotchkiss machine gun]] on [[Minerva (automobile)|Minerva]] armoured cars. Their successes in the early days of the war convinced the Belgian GHQ to create a [[Belgian Expeditionary Corps in Russia|Corps of Armoured Cars]], who would be sent to fight on the Eastern front once the western front immobilized after the [[Battle of the Yser]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philatelicdatabase.com/postal-history/wwi-belgium-armoured-car-division-in-russia/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wio.ru/tank/for-rus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/Russia/Russia_00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Naval Air Service]] dispatched aircraft to Dunkirk to defend the UK from Zeppelins. The officers' cars followed them and these began to be used to rescue downed reconnaissance pilots in the battle areas. They mounted machine guns on them&lt;ref&gt;''Band of Brigands'' p 59&lt;/ref&gt; and as these excursions became increasingly dangerous, they improvised boiler plate armoring on the vehicles provided by a local shipbuilder. In London [[Murray Sueter]] ordered &quot;fighting cars&quot; based on Rolls-Royce, Talbot and Wolseley chassis. By the time [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]]s arrived in December 1914, the mobile period on the Western Front was already over.&lt;ref&gt;''First World War'' - Willmott, H.P., [[Dorling Kindersley]], 2003, Pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; As described below, they had a fascinating birth and long and interesting service.

More tactically important were the development of formed units of armoured cars, such as the [[Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade]], which was the first fully mechanized unit in the history of the British Army. The brigade was established on September 2, 1914 in [[Ottawa]], as Automobile Machine Gun Brigade No. 1 by [[Raymond Brutinel|Brigadier-General Raymond Brutinel]]. The Brigade was originally equipped with 8 Armoured Autocars mounting 2 machine guns. By 1918 Brutinel's force consisted of two Motor Machine Gun Brigades (each of five gun batteries containing eight weapons apiece).&lt;ref&gt;P. Griffith p 129 &quot;Battle Tactics on the Western Front - The British Army's art of attack 1916–18 Yale university Press quoting the Official History 1918 vol.4, p42&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade, and its armoured cars, provided yeoman service in many battles, notably at Amiens.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Pulsifer (2007). ' 'The Armoured Autocar in Canadian Service' ', [[Service Publications]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rolls-Royce Armoured Car was famously proposed, developed, and utilised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verdin|first=Lt.-Col. Sir Richard|title=The Cheshire (Earl of Chester's) Yeomanry|year=1971|publisher=Willmer Bros. Ltd|location=Birkenhead|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by the [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster|2nd Duke of Westminster]]. He took a squadron of these cars to France in time to make a noted contribution to the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], and thereafter the cars with their master were sent to the Middle East to play a part in the British campaign in [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestine]] and elsewhere. These cars appear in the memoirs of numerous officers of the BEF during the earlier stages of the Great War - their ducal master often being described in an almost piratical style.

=== World War II ===

&lt;!-- The spelling &quot;Armored Car&quot; is a proper noun here: do not change. --&gt;]]

The British RAF in the [[Middle East]] was equipped with [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]]s and Morris tenders. Some of these vehicles were among the last of a consignment of ex-[[Royal Navy]] armored cars that had been serving in the [[Middle East]] since 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, ''Iraq 1941'', pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1940 a section of the No. 2 Squadron RAF Regiment Company was detached to [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|General Wavell’s ground]] forces during the first offensive against the Italians in Egypt. It is said{{By whom|date=July 2010}} that these armored cars became ‘the eyes and ears of Wavell’. During the actions in the October of that year the Company was employed on convoy escort tasks, airfield defense, fighting reconnaissance patrols and screening operations.

The American [[M8 Greyhound|M8 Light Armored Car]] was a 6x6 armored car produced by the [[Ford Motor Company]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] intended initially as a fast wheeled [[tank destroyer]]. Its design style and excellent cross-country performance was well liked. In British service it was named 'Greyhound'. However, the small 37&amp;nbsp;mm gun would not be effective against the front armor of German tanks so as an armored car, designated M8 Light Armored Car, it was used for reconnaissance instead.&lt;ref name=Zaloga&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaloga|first=Steve |title=M8 Greyhound Light Armored Car|year=2002 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=1-84176-468-X|page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its small 37&amp;nbsp;mm gun and light armor was seen as a flaw, but was produced in such a large volume and, coupled with its off-road capability, that this shortcoming was largely overlooked. The M8 Greyhound was a supportive element to the advancing American and British armored columns. It was used by the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] troops in [[Europe]] and the [[Far East]] until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=Zaloga&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaloga|first=Steve |title=M8 Greyhound Light Armored Car|year=2002 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=1-84176-468-X|page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A military armored car is a type of [[armored fighting vehicle]] having [[wheel]]s (from four to ten large, off-road wheels) instead of [[Caterpillar track|tracks]], and usually light [[vehicle armor|armor]]. Armored cars are typically less expensive and on roads have better speed and range than tracked military vehicles. They do however have less mobility as they have less off-road capabilities because of the higher ground pressure. They also have less obstacle climbing capabilities than tracked vehicles. Wheels are more vulnerable to enemy fire than tracks, they have a higher signature and in most cases less armor than comparable tracked vehicles. As a result they are not intended for heavy fighting; their normal use is for [[reconnaissance]], command, control, and communications, or for use against lightly armed insurgents or rioters. Only some are intended to enter close combat, often accompanying convoys to protect soft-skinned vehicles.

Light armored cars, such as the British [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret]] are armed with just a machine gun. Heavier vehicles are armed with [[autocannon]] or a small tank gun. The heaviest armored cars, such as the German, World War II era [[SdKfz 234]] or the modern, US [[M1128 Mobile Gun System]], mount the same guns that arm medium tanks.

[[Image:DanishResistanceAC2795.jpg|thumb|left||Vehicle built by railway shop workers for the [[Danish resistance movement]], near the end of World War II]]
Armored cars are popular for peacekeeping or internal security duties. Their appearance is less confrontational and threatening than tanks, and their size and maneuverability is said to be more compatible with tight urban spaces designed for wheeled vehicles. However they do have a larger turning radius compared to tracked vehicles which can turn on the spot and their tires are vulnerable and are less capable in climbing and crushing obstacles. However when there is true combat they are easily outgunned and lightly armored. The threatening appearance of a tank is often enough to keep an opponent from attacking, whereas a less threatening vehicle such as an armored car is more likely to be attacked.

Many modern forces now have their dedicated armored car designs, to exploit the advantages noted above. Examples would be the [[M1117 Armored Security Vehicle]] of the [[United States|USA]] or [[Alvis Saladin]] of the post-World War II era in the [[United Kingdom]].

Alternatively, civilian vehicles may be modified into improvised armored cars in ''ad hoc'' fashion. Many militias and irregular forces adapt civilian vehicles into AFVs (armored fighting vehicles) and troop carriers, and in some regional conflicts these [[technical (fighting vehicle)|&quot;technicals&quot;]] are the only combat vehicles present. On occasion, even the soldiers of national militaries are forced to adapt their [[Gun truck|civilian-type vehicles]] for combat use, often using [[Improvised vehicle armour|improvised armor]] and scrounged weapons.

[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|300px|Soviet-made ZSU-23-4 at [[Camp Pendleton]].]]
An '''anti-aircraft vehicle''', also known as a '''self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon''' ('''SPAA''') or '''self-propelled air defense system''' ('''SPAD'''), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated anti-aircraft capability. The [[Russian language|Russian]] equivalent of ''SPAAG'' is ''ZSU'', for ''zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka'', (&quot;anti-aircraft self-propelled mount&quot;).

Specific weapon systems used include [[machine gun]]s, [[autocannon]]s, larger guns, or [[missile]]s, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles. Platforms used include both [[truck]]s and heavier [[combat vehicle]]s such as [[armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] and [[tank]]s, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment.

Anti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing [[gun turret|turret]] with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire. Today, [[missile]]s (generally mounted on similar turrets) have largely supplanted anti-aircraft guns.

==History==
[[Image:3inch20cwtAAgunPeerlessLorryWWIQuality90.jpg|thumb|right|A World War 1, British, truck–mounted, QF 3 inch gun]]

===World War I===
Anti-aircraft machine guns have long been mounted on trucks, and these were quite common during [[World War I]]. A predecessor of the WW2 German &quot;88&quot; anti-aircraft gun, the WWI German 77&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, was truck-mounted and used to great effect against British tanks.

The British [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt]] was mounted on trucks for use on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

===Inter-war period===
Between the two World Wars the United Kingdom developed the [[Birch gun]], a general purpose artillery piece on an armoured tracked chassis capable of maintaining formation with their current tanks. The gun could be elevated for anti-aircraft use.

Vickers Armstrong also developed a SPAGG based on the chassis of the Mk.E 6-ton light tank/Dragon Medium Mark IV tractor, mounting a Vickers QF-1 &quot;Pom-Pom&quot; gun of 40&amp;nbsp;mm. About 26 were sold to Siam and saw action as Infantry support guns and AA guns during the Franco-Thai war (1940-1941)along with 30 Vickers Mk.E Type B 6-ton tanks. This was probably the first tracked SPAAG manufactured in series. Later the British also developed a version of the Mk.VI light tank armed with 4 machine guns that was known as Light Tank AA Mk.I. And also a twin 15&amp;nbsp;mm version based on the Light Tank Mk.V was built.

Among early pre-war pioneers of self-propelled AA guns were the Germans. By the time of the war, they fielded the SdKfz 10/4 and 6/2, cargo halftracks mounting single 20&amp;nbsp;mm or 37&amp;nbsp;mm AA guns (respectively). Later in the war similar German halftracks mounted quadruple 20&amp;nbsp;mm weapons.

===World War II===
Larger guns followed on larger trucks, but these mountings generally required off-truck setup in order to unlimber the stabilizing legs these guns needed. One exception to this rule was the Italian [[Cannone da 90/53]] which was highly effective when mounted on trucks, a fit known as the &quot;''autocannoni da 90/53''&quot;. The 90/53 was a feared weapon, notably in the anti-tank role, but only a few hundred had been produced by the time of the armistice in 1943.

Other nations tended to work on truck chassis. Starting in 1941, the British developed the &quot;en [[portee]]&quot; method of mounting an anti-tank gun (initially a [[2 pounder]]) on a truck. This was to prevent the weapon from being damaged by long-distance towing across rough, stony deserts, and it was intended only to be a carrying method, with the gun unloaded for firing. However, crews tended to fire their weapons from their vehicles for the mobility this method provided, with consequent casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;avalon&quot;&gt;''[[Advanced Squad Leader]]'', [[Avalon Hill]]&lt;/ref&gt;  
This undoubtedly inspired their Morris C9/B (officially the &quot;Carrier, SP, 4x4, 40 mm AA&quot;), a Bofors 40&amp;nbsp;mm AA gun mounted on a chassis derived from the [[Morris C8|Morris &quot;Quad&quot;]] Field Artillery Tractor truck.&lt;ref name=&quot;avalon&quot; /&gt; Similar types, based on 3-ton lorries, were produced in Britain, Canada and Australia, and together formed the most numerous self-propelled AA guns in British service.&lt;ref name=&quot;avalon&quot; /&gt;

The U.S. Army brought truck-towed [[Bofors 40 mm]] AA guns along with truck-mounted units fitted with mechanized turrets when they sailed, first for Great Britain and then onto France.  The turrets carried four .50&amp;nbsp;inch (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns, which were designed to be adjusted to converge at the single point where enemy aircraft were expected to appear at low altitude in conduction of strafing runs directed at large infantry and field artillery units. 

Interest in mobile AA turned to heavier vehicles with the mass and stability needed to easily train weapons of all sizes. Probably the desire, particularly in German service, for anti-aircraft vehicles to be armoured for their own protection also assisted this trend.

The concept of an armored SPAAG was pioneered by [[Hungary]] during [[World War II]] [[Hungary]] by producing the [[40M Nimrod]] based on the [[Luftvärnskanonvagn L-62 Anti II]] license acquired from [[Sweden]]. [[Germany]] followed later with their &quot;''Flakpanzer''&quot; series. German World War II SPAAGs include the [[Möbelwagen]], [[Wirbelwind]], [[Ostwind]] and [[Kugelblitz]]. Other forces followed with designs of their own, notably the American M16 created by mounting quadruple [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 machine guns]] on a [[M3 Half-track]].

The British developed their own SPAAGs throughout the war mounting multiple machine guns and light cannon on various tank and armoured car chassis and by 1943, the [[Crusader tank|Crusader AA tanks]], which mounted the [[Bofors 40 mm]] gun or two-three [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]]. Although used during the Normandy landings, by that point German aircraft were contained by the Allies own air forces and they were largely unneeded.

===Cold War and later===
[[File:Gepard 1a2 overview.jpg|thumb|[[Flakpanzer Gepard]], [[Germany]]]]
On occasion SPAAGs have been used as very effective direct fire weapons against infantry, for example by American forces during late World War II, in Korea against mass infantry assault, and extensively during the [[Vietnam War]], where for example the U.S. [[M42 Duster]] SPAAG (based on a light tank) was employed purely for this purpose. Nowadays the system is rather superfluous due to the lack of a threat from sophisticated gunship helicopters, but development continues.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Modern weapons include the [[Russia]]n [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4 Shilka]] and [[Tunguska-M1]], [[South Korea]]n [[K30 Biho]] and [[K200 KIFV|K263A1 radar-guided Vulcan]], [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[Type 95 SPAAA]], [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Combat Vehicle 90|CV9040 AAV]], Polish [[PZA Loara]], American [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle#M6 Linebacker|M6 Bradley Linebacker]] and [[M1097 Avenger|M1097 Humvee Avenger]], [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] [[BOV (APC)|BOV-3]], Canadian [[Air Defense Anti-Tank System|ADATS]], aging [[Germany|German]] [[Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard|Gepard]], Japanese [[Type 87 Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun|Type 87 SPAAG]] and similar versions with the British [[Marksman anti-aircraft system|Marksman turret]] (which was also adapted for a number of other users), [[Italy|Italian]] [[SIDAM 25]] and [[Otomatic]], and versions of the [[France|French]] [[AMX-13]]. Older post-war examples include the [[ZSU-57-2]], [[M163 VADS]] (mounting the [[Vulcan cannon]]) and failed [[M247 Sergeant York]].

'''Alkmaar Zaanstreek''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɑlkmaːr ˈzaːnstreːk|}}), better known as '''AZ Alkmaar''' or simply '''AZ''' ({{IPA-nl|aːˈzɛt}}), is an [[association football]] club from [[Alkmaar]] and the [[Zaanstreek]], Netherlands.

The club plays in the [[Eredivisie]], the highest football league in the Netherlands. AZ was founded in 1967 as ''AZ '67''.

==History==
AZ was founded on 10 May 1967 as '''AZ '67''', the result of a merger of '''Alkmaar '54''' and '''FC Zaanstreek'''. FC Zaanstreek was formed in 1964, continuing the professional adventure of the [[Koog aan de Zaan|Kooger]] Football Club ('''[[:nl:KFC (voetbalclub)|KFC]]'''). KFC had been founded in 1910, had nearly become National Champion in 1934 through a narrow loss to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the finals, and had been professional since 1955.

In 1964, the brothers Cees and Klaas Molenaar, former players for KFC and owners of a growing appliance store chain, sought to create a powerful football team in the Zaanstreek by merging the two local professional teams (KFC and [[:nl:ZFC|ZFC]]). After this merger failed, they successfully merged KFC (now &quot;FC Zaanstreek&quot;) with Alkmaar '54, though the team would be located in Alkmaar. Partially through the hiring of expensive foreign players, the new club soon acquired large debts. Fortunately in 1972 the brothers Molenaar bailed it out and invested heavily in the club, to the point that AZ '67 were successful in the late seventies and early eighties, playing European football in five of the six seasons from 1977 to 1982 and winning the [[Dutch Cup]] three times over that period.

After four near-misses, AZ finally became [[Eredivisie|Dutch champions]] in 1981. They were the only team other than the &quot;big three&quot; (Ajax, [[Feyenoord]], and [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]]) to do so in a period stretching from 1965 to 2009, when AZ repeated as champions. They won the [[1980–81 Eredivisie|1980–81 season]] with overwhelming power, winning 27 of 34 matches while losing only one, and scoring 101 goals while allowing only 30. The same season they reached the [[1981 UEFA Cup Final|final of the UEFA Cup]], losing 4:5 on aggregate to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The next year in the [[1981–82 European Cup|UEFA Champions League]] they lost in the second round 2:3 on aggregate to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. [[Georg Keßler]] was AZ's manager over most of these years (1978–1982), while star players included [[Kees Kist]], [[Jan Peters (footballer)|Jan Peters]], [[Hugo Hovenkamp]], [[John Metgod]] and [[Kristen Nygaard (footballer)|Kristen Nygaard]].

Things went downhill after Klaas Molenaar left the club in 1985 (Cees had died in 1979). In 1988, AZ were even relegated from the [[Eredivisie]].

The involvement of businessman Dirk Scheringa in the mid-'90s marked the revival of the club. AZ returned to the [[Eredivisie]] in 1998. In 2004–05, they reappeared in the [[UEFA Cup]] tournament, advancing to the semi-finals. The second leg of these semis against [[Sporting CP]] had a heart-breaking ending, when Sporting scored in the 122nd minute (2 minutes into stoppage time) to reach an aggregate tie of 4:4, but to win on [[away goals]]. AZ also finished third in the Eredivisie that season, again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, after spending most of the season in the top two spots. These were remarkable achievements for a small club like AZ, which does not have a similar fanbase as their Eredivisie and European rivals: AZ's home ground until the 2006-07 season, the [[Alkmaarderhout]], had a spectator capacity of 8,390.

In the summer of 2006, the club moved to a new 17,000 capacity stadium [[AZ Stadion]].Club's chairman Dirk Scheringa stated in 2007 that he wished to expand the stadium capacity to 40,000 by 2010.Ultimately, the club began plans to expand the stadium to at least 30,000 seats by 2011–12.

AZ had a very good 2006–07 season, which ended, however, in disaster. Going into the last game of the 2006–07 season, AZ led [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and Ajax by goal-differential for the [[Eredivisie]] championship, but ended up third after losing this last match against bottom-dweller [[Excelsior Rotterdam|Excelsior]], playing with 10 men for 80 minutes. Further setbacks followed when AZ lost the [[KNVB Cup]] finals to Ajax, 8–7 in penalty kicks after a drawn game, and also lost to Ajax over two playoff games for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. After the season, key players like [[Tim de Cler]], [[Danny Koevermans]], and [[Shota Arveladze]] left the team.

[[File:AZ Larisa UEFA Cup0708.jpg|thumb|right|220px|AZ versus [[Larissa F.C.|Larissa]] in a [[2007–08 UEFA Cup]] match.]]
A remarkable run ended in the 2007-08 season: AZ had been undefeated in their first 32 home matches in European competitions, a sequence which ran from 1977 until 20 December 2007, when they finally lost to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] of [[Premier League|England]] by a score of 3–2. In this season, AZ performed so badly (first round loss in the KNVB Cup, elimination from the UEFA Cup before winter break and a final 11th position in the Eredivisie), that team manager [[Louis van Gaal]] felt obliged to hand in his resignation in March 2008. However, after protests from the players and direction, van Gaal withdrew his resignation to finish his contractual obligations.

The 2008–09 season had an unpromising start with two defeats against [[NAC Breda]] and [[ADO Den Haag]]. However, starting with a 1–0 victory over defending league champions PSV, the team didn't lose in the next 28 matches, including a stretch of 11 matches in which the opposing teams did not score a single goal. Three weeks before the end of the season, despite their second home defeat of the season (against [[Vitesse]]), AZ became [[Eredivisie]] champions when nearest rivals [[FC Twente|Twente]] and Ajax both lost their matches.AZ qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the second time, but only took four points from six matches and finished bottom of their group.

[[Ronald Koeman]], succeeded [[Louis van Gaal]] after the 2008–09 season. Van Gaal had already left for [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] after becoming league champions with AZ. Koeman became the manager for AZ on 17 May 2009.On 5 December 2009 AZ announced that Koeman no longer was in charge of AZ, after losing 7 of the first 16 games in the Dutch competition.Former [[Zenit St. Petersburg]] manager [[Dick Advocaat]] took over for the rest of the season. Under his lead, some good results were achieved and European football was secured. For the 2010–2011 season, [[Gertjan Verbeek]], coming from [[Heracles Almelo]], will be the new manager.

==Stadium and sponsor==
{{See also|AFAS Stadion}}

[[File:DSB-Stadion.jpg|250px|right|thumb|AFAS Stadion, AZ's home venue in Alkmaar]]

AZ play their home games at the [[AFAS Stadion]], located in the southern part of the city of [[Alkmaar]]. The stadium, which is owned directly by the club, was inaugurated in 2006 and replaced the old [[Alkmaarderhout]] venue as the [[DSB Bank|DSB Stadion]]. The stadium currently has a capacity of ''17,023''. During its design stages the name Victorie Stadion was frequently used, referring to the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch War of Independence]], the phrase ''&quot;n Alkmaar begint de victorie&quot; (Victory begins in Alkmaar)'' in particular. Until now, this name hasn't been officially in use, the board instead opting for sponsorship deals because of financial motives. However, to this day the name maintains a good share of support among the fans.

In order to further grow the club's budget, the ''AZ board'' of directors has decided to extend the capacity of the new stadium to a minimum of ''30,000'' seated spectators somewhere in the near future. The extension will be realised to construct a second tier to three of the four stands. The main stand with all technical areas, ''VIP'' and sponsor and media facilities will remain in place.

In October 2009 sponsor [[DSB Bank]] was declared bankrupt.
The stadium name temporarily changed from DSB Stadion to AZ Stadion, as it was considered undesirable that the stadium was linked with a non-existent bank. In February 2010 a new main sponsor was found: construction works service provider BUKO from [[Beverwijk]].

A year later, in the season [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11]], ''[[AFAS Erp Software]]'' took over as official shirt sponsor, also taking over duties as stadium sponsor. The current external name of the ground is [[AFAS Stadion]].

==Trivia==
As of 2012, AZ is the only club to have beaten [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[Feyenoord]] and [[PSV (football club)|PSV]] away from home in a [[1980–81 Eredivisie|single Eredivisie season]]. [[sc Heerenveen]] managed to do the same in 2008–09, though their away victory at Feyenoord was a [[KNVB Cup]] match (Heerenveen had drawn 2–2 at [[De Kuip]] in the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] match).

In [[mammal]]s, the '''adrenal glands''' (also known as '''suprarenal glands''') are [[endocrine gland]]s that sit at the top of the [[kidney]]s; in humans, the right adrenal gland is triangular shaped, while the left adrenal gland is semilunar shaped.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.organsofthebody.com/adrenal-glands/|title= FeedBack What Is Adrenal Gland? Adrenal Gland Diseases|publisher=OrgansOfTheBody|accessdate=17/9/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;They are chiefly responsible for releasing [[hormone]]s in response to [[stress (medicine)|stress]] through the [[biosynthesis|synthesis]] of [[corticosteroid]]s such as [[cortisol]] and [[catecholamine]]s such as [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) and [[norepinephrine]]. These endocrine glands also produce [[androgen]]s in their innermost cortical layer. The adrenal glands affect kidney function through the secretion of [[aldosterone]], and recent data (1998) suggest that adrenocortical cells under [[Pathology|pathological]] as well as under [[Physiology|physiological]] conditions show [[neuroendocrine]] properties; within the normal adrenal, this neuroendocrine differentiation seems to be restricted to cells of the [[zona glomerulosa]] and might be important for an [[autocrine]] regulation of adrenocortical function.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9694576&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ehrhart-Bornstein M, Hilbers U |title=Neuroendocrine properties of adrenocortical cells. |journal=Horm Metab Res. |volume=30 |issue=6-7 |pages=436–439 |year=1998 |month=June–July |pmid=9694576 |doi= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9694576 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy and physiology==
The adrenal glands are located in the [[retroperitoneum]] superior to the [[kidney]]s, they are quadrilaterial in shape and are situated bilaterally.  The combined weight of the adrenal glands in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/obgynsurvey/Citation/1972/01000/Reinfection_With_Rubella_in_Pregnant_Women.4.aspx Page 18] in: {{cite journal |author=Boué A, Nicolas A, Montagnon B |title=Reinfection with rubella in pregnant women |journal=Lancet |volume=297 |issue=7712 |pages=1251–3 |year=1971 |month=June |pmid=4104713 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(71)91775-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are surrounded by an [[adipose capsule]] and [[renal fascia]].

Each adrenal gland has two distinct structures, the outer [[adrenal cortex]] and the inner [[adrenal medulla|medulla]], both of which produce hormones. The cortex mainly produces [[cortisol]], [[aldosterone]] and [[androgen]]s, while the medulla chiefly produces [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].  In contrast to the direct innervation of the medulla, the cortex is regulated by [[neuroendocrine]] hormones secreted from the [[pituitary gland]] which are under the control of the [[hypothalamus]], as well as by the [[renin-angiotensin system]].

===Cortex===
The [[adrenal cortex]] is devoted to production of [[corticosteroid]] and [[androgen]] [[hormones]]. Specific cortical cells produce particular hormones including [[aldosterone]], [[cortisol]], and [[androgen]]s such as [[androstenedione]].  Under normal unstressed conditions, the human adrenal glands produce the equivalent of 35–40&amp;nbsp;mg of cortisone acetate per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;safeuses&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Jefferies, William McK |title=Safe uses of cortisol |publisher=Charles C. Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-398-07500-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adrenal cortex comprises three zones, or layers.  This ''anatomic zonation'' can be appreciated at the microscopic level, where each zone can be recognized and distinguished from one another based on structural and anatomic characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehead&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Whitehead, Saffron A.; Nussey, Stephen |title=Endocrinology: an integrated approach |publisher=BIOS |location=Oxford |year=2001 |pages=122 |isbn=1-85996-252-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adrenal cortex exhibits ''functional zonation'' as well: by virtue of the characteristic enzymes present in each zone, the zones produce and secrete distinct hormones.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehead&quot;/&gt;

;Zona glomerulosa (outer)
:The outermost layer, the [[zona glomerulosa]] is the main site for production of [[aldosterone]], a [[mineralocorticoid]], by the action of the enzyme [[aldosterone synthase]] (also known as [[Aldosterone synthase|CYP11B2]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1775135&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Curnow KM, Tusie-Luna MT, Pascoe L, Natarajan R, Gu JL, Nadler JL, White PC |title=The product of the CYP11B2 gene is required for aldosterone biosynthesis in the human adrenal cortex. |journal=Mol Endocrinol. |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=1513–1522 |year=1991 |month=October |pmid=1775135 |doi= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1775135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8333830&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhou M, Gomez-Sanchez CE |title=Cloning and expression of a rat cytochrome P-450 11 beta-hydroxylase/aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) cDNA variant. |journal=Biochem Biophys Res Commun. |volume=194 |issue=1 |pages=112–117 |year=1993 |month=July |pmid=8333830 |doi= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8333830 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aldosterone is largely responsible for the long-term [[regulation of blood pressure]].&lt;ref name=Marieb&gt;Marieb Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology 9th edition, chapter:16, page:629, question number:14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aldosterone]]'s effects are on the [[distal convoluted tubule]] and [[Collecting duct system|collecting duct of the kidney]] where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both  potassium (by principal cells) and hydrogen ions (by intercalated cells of the collecting duct).&lt;ref name=&quot;Marieb&quot;/&gt; Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon, and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Although sustained production of aldosterone requires persistent [[calcium]] entry through low-voltage activated [[Calcium channel|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels]], isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit [[Calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] channels entry.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22546854&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hu C, Rusin CG, Tan Z, Guagliardo NA, Barrett PQ |title=Zona glomerulosa cells of the mouse adrenal cortex are intrinsic electricaloscillators. |journal=J Clin Invest. |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=2046–2053 |year=2012 |month=June |pmid=22546854 |doi=10.1172/JCI61996 |url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/61996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mouse zona glomerulosa cells within adrenal slices spontaneously generate membrane potential oscillations of low periodicity; this innate electrical excitability of zona glomerulosa cells provides a platform for the production of a recurrent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels signal that can be controlled by [[angiotensin II]] and extracellular [[potassium]], the 2 major regulators of aldosterone production.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22546854&quot;/&gt; Angiotensin II originates from plasmatic [[angiotensin I]] after the conversion of [[angiotensinogen]] by [[renin]] produced by the [[juxtaglomerular cells]] of the [[kidney]].&lt;ref name=Kaplan.Physio&gt;{{cite book|title=Kaplan USMLE Step 1 Physiology Lecture Notes|year=2011|author=Dunn R.

;Zona fasciculata
:Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the [[zona fasciculata]] is responsible for producing [[glucocorticoid]]s, such as [[11-deoxycorticosterone]], [[corticosterone]], and [[cortisol]] in humans.  Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid under normal conditions and its actions include mobilization of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, but it does not increase under starvation conditions.&lt;ref name=Kaplan.Physio /&gt;  Additionally, cortisol enhances the activity of other hormones including glucagon and catecholamines.  The zona fasciculata secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) from the [[anterior pituitary]].

;Zona reticularis
:The inner most cortical layer, the [[zona reticularis]] produces [[androgen]]s, mainly [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), [[DHEA sulfate]] (DHEA-S), and [[androstenedione]] (the precursor to [[testosterone]]) in humans.&lt;ref name=Kaplan.Physio /&gt;

===Medulla===
The [[adrenal medulla]] is the core of the adrenal gland, and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex.  It secretes approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine).&lt;ref name=Kaplan.Physio /&gt;  The [[chromaffin cell]]s of the medulla, named for their characteristic brown staining with [[chromic acid]] salts, are the body's main source of the circulating [[catecholamine]]s adrenaline and noradrenaline.  Catecholamines are derived from the amino acid [[tyrosine]] and these water-soluble hormones are the major hormones underlying the [[fight-or-flight response]].

To carry out its part of this response, the adrenal medulla receives input from the [[sympathetic nervous system]] through [[preganglionic fiber]]s originating in the [[thoracic spinal cord]] from T5–T11.&lt;ref name=&quot;essentialneuroscience&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Sapru, Hreday N.; Siegel, Allan |title=Essential Neuroscience |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-9121-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is innervated by [[preganglionic nerve fibers]], the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized [[sympathetic ganglion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;essentialneuroscience&quot;/&gt; Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.

Cortisol also promotes epinephrine synthesis in the medulla. Produced in the cortex, cortisol reaches the adrenal medulla and at high levels, the hormone can promote the upregulation of [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine ''N''-methyltransferase]] (PNMT), thereby increasing epinephrine synthesis and secretion.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehead&quot;/&gt;

===Blood supply===
Although variations of the blood supply to the adrenal glands (and indeed the kidneys themselves) are common, there are usually three arteries that supply each adrenal gland:
* The [[superior suprarenal artery]] is provided by the [[inferior phrenic arteries|inferior phrenic artery]]
* The [[middle suprarenal artery]] is provided by the [[abdominal aorta]]
* The [[inferior suprarenal artery]] is provided by the [[renal artery]]

[[Venous]] drainage of the adrenal glands is achieved via the [[suprarenal veins]]:
* The [[right suprarenal vein]] drains into the [[inferior vena cava]]
* The [[left suprarenal vein]] drains into the left [[renal vein]] or the left [[inferior phrenic vein]].

The [[suprarenal veins]] may form [[anastomoses]] with the [[inferior phrenic veins]]. Since the right supra-renal vein is short and drains directly into the inferior vena cava it is likely to injure the latter during removal of right adrenal for various reasons.

The adrenal glands and the [[thyroid gland]] are the organs that have the greatest blood supply per gram of tissue. Up to 60 [[arterioles]] may enter each adrenal gland.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn960-399-074-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Mirilas P, Skandalakis JE, Colborn GL, Weidman TA, Foster RS, Kingsnorth A, Skandalakis LJ, Skandalakis PN |title=Surgical Anatomy: The Embryologic And Anatomic Basis Of Modern Surgery |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=960-399-074-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be one of the reasons lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the adrenals.

==Diseases involving the adrenal glands==
* Several [[adrenal tumor]]s cause symptoms because they result in the over- or underproduction of certain hormones by the adrenal gland.
* In [[hyperaldosteronism]] the adrenal glands produce too much aldosterone.
* In [[pheochromocytoma]] the adrenal glands secretes excessive amounts of catecholamines.
* In endogenous [[Cushing's syndrome]] the adrenal glands produce too much cortisol.
* [[Adrenal insufficiency]] denotes a group of diseases characterized by underproduction of cortisol or aldosterone. They can be caused by problems in the adrenal glands themselves, or by impairment of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. The [[ACTH stimulation test]] may assist in diagnosis.
** [[Addison's disease]] is a rare disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient amounts of [[glucocorticoid]]s (mainly cortisol). This can be caused by an [[autoimmune reaction]], by certain infections or by some other rarer causes.
** [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]s are genetic defects of enzymes involved in cortisol production and can affect sex characteristics of affected patients.
** [[Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome]] is adrenal gland failure due to bleeding into the adrenal glands, caused by severe bacterial infection.
* Isolated [[hypoaldosteronism]] can rarely occur due to [[aldosterone synthase]] deficiency
* [[Absent adrenal gland]], rare congenital condition

==Terminology==
The adrenal glands are named for their location relative to the kidneys. The term &quot;adrenal&quot; comes from ''ad-'' (Latin, &quot;near&quot;) and ''renes'' (Latin, &quot;kidney&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/aindex/g/adrenal-glands.htm|title=What Are The Adrenal Glands?|accessdate=18/9/2013|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, &quot;suprarenal&quot; is derived from ''supra-'' (Latin, &quot;above&quot;) and ''renes''.

'''American Media, Inc.''' is an [[United States|American]] publisher of magazines, [[supermarket tabloid]]s, and books.

==Company background==
&quot;American Media&quot; is not to be confused with the international event coverage firm &quot;American Media Distribution&quot; (www.americanmediadistribution.com). The modern American Media came into being after [[Generoso Pope, Jr.]], longtime owner of ''[[The National Enquirer]]'', died in 1988, and his tabloids came under new ownership. American tabloids began consolidating in 1990, when American Media bought ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' from Rupert Murdoch. The purchase of Globe Communications (owner of the ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'' and the ''[[National Examiner]]'') followed nine years later.

American Media's corporate headquarters in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], figured prominently in news headlines in late 2001, after an [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax attack]] was perpetrated on the company. Since then the corporate headquarters have moved to [[New York City]] at 1 Park Avenue in [[Manhattan]], before moving to the [[Financial District]] to the former [[JP Morgan Chase]] headquarters at 4 New York Plaza. That building was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Sandy]] but reopened in February 2013. The [[CEO]], [[David J. Pecker]], travels between the Boca Raton and New York offices while managing the company.

AMI continued to expand after it bought [[Joe Weider]]'s Weider Publications in 2002. Joe Weider continues to manage control of his magazines under AMI's Weider Publications subsidiary.

American Media also owns Distribution Services, an in-store magazine merchandising company. In fall 2002, it launched the book-publishing [[imprint]], AMI Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20030804/21271-american-media-to-expand-book-program-.html|volume= 250 |issue =31 |date=August 04, 2003|title=American Media to Expand Book Program|first=Jim |last=Milliot|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|archivedate=February 29, 2012|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/65pNvadXR|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Altman]], through [[Evercore Partners]], bought a controlling stake in American Media in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1007/The_Clintonite_who_owns_National_Enquirer.html The Clintonite who owns National Enquirer] Ben Smith, ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'', October 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, American Media was taken over by its bondholders to keep it out of bankruptcy.

In November 2010, American Media filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection due to nearly $1 billion in debt, and assets of less than $50,000. Its subsidiary, American Media Operations Inc., listed assets of $100 to $500 million and debt of over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='National Enquirer' Publisher Files for Chapter 11|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=17 November 2010|accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exited in December.

The '''Cauchy distribution''', named after [[Augustin Cauchy]], is a [[continuous probability distribution]].  It is also known, especially among physicists, as the '''Lorentz distribution''' (after [[Hendrik Lorentz]]), '''Cauchy–Lorentz distribution''', '''Lorentz(ian) function''', or '''Breit–Wigner distribution'''.
The simplest Cauchy distribution is called the '''standard Cauchy distribution'''. It has the distribution of a random variable that is the ratio of two independent standard normal random variables.  This has the probability density function
:&lt;math&gt; f(x; 0,1) = \frac{1}{\pi (1 + x^2)}. \!&lt;/math&gt;
Its cumulative distribution function has the shape of an arctangent function arctan(''x''):
:&lt;math&gt;F(x; 0,1)=\frac{1}{\pi} \arctan\left(x\right)+\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The Cauchy distribution is often used in statistics as the canonical example of a &quot;[[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]]&quot; distribution. Both its [[mean]] and its [[variance]] are undefined. (But see the section ''[[#Explanation of undefined moments|Explanation of undefined moments]]'' below.) The Cauchy distribution does not have finite [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s of order greater than or equal to one; only fractional absolute moments exist.&lt;ref name=jkb1&gt;{{cite book|author=N. L. Johnson, S. Kotz, and N. Balakrishnan|title=Continuous Univariate Distributions, Volume 1|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1994|ref=harv}}, Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cauchy distribution has no [[moment generating function]].

Its importance in [[physics]] is the result of it being the solution to the [[differential equation]] describing [[Simple Harmonic Oscillator|forced resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://webphysics.davidson.edu/Projects/AnAntonelli/node5.html  Note that the intensity, which follows the Cauchy distribution, is the square of the amplitude.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mathematics]], it is closely related to the [[Poisson kernel]], which is the [[fundamental solution]] for the [[Laplace equation]] in the [[upper half-plane]].  In [[spectroscopy]], it is the description of the shape of [[spectral line]]s which are subject to [[homogeneous broadening]] in which all atoms interact in the same way with the frequency range contained in the line shape. Many mechanisms cause homogeneous broadening, most notably [[Line_broadening#Spectral_line_broadening_and_shift|collision broadening]], and Chantler–Alda [[radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=E.

==Characterisation==

===Probability density function===
The Cauchy distribution has the [[probability density function]]
:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi\gamma \left[1 + \left(\frac{x - x_0}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]} = { 1 \over \pi } \left[ { \gamma \over (x - x_0)^2 + \gamma^2  } \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[location parameter]], specifying the location of the peak of the distribution, and γ is the [[scale parameter]] which specifies the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM), alternatively 2γ is [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM). γ is also equal to half the [[interquartile range]] and is sometimes called the [[probable error]].  [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] exploited such a density function in 1827 with an [[infinitesimal]] scale parameter, defining what would now be called a [[Dirac delta function]].

The amplitude of the above Lorentzian function is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Amplitude (or  height)} = \frac{1}{\pi\gamma}. &lt;/math&gt;

The special case when ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and γ = 1 is called the '''standard Cauchy distribution''' with the probability density function
:&lt;math&gt; f(x; 0,1) = \frac{1}{\pi (1 + x^2)}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

In physics, a three-parameter Lorentzian function is often used:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\gamma,I) = \frac{I}{\left[1 + \left(\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]} = I \left[ { \gamma^2 \over (x - x_0)^2 + \gamma^2  } \right], &lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' is the height of the peak.

===Cumulative distribution function===
The [[cumulative distribution function]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x; x_0,\gamma)=\frac{1}{\pi} \arctan\left(\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma}\right)+\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[quantile function]] (inverse [[cumulative distribution function|cdf]]) of the Cauchy distribution is
:&lt;math&gt;Q(p; x_0,\gamma) = x_0 + \gamma\,\tan\left[\pi\left(p-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\right].&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that the first and third quartiles are (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;−γ, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+γ), and hence the [[interquartile range]] is 2γ.

The derivative of the [[quantile function]], the quantile density function, for the Cauchy distribution is:
:&lt;math&gt;Q'(p; \gamma) = \gamma\,\pi\,{\sec}^2\left[\pi\left(p-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\right].\!&lt;/math&gt;
The [[differential entropy]] of a distribution can be defined in terms of its quantile density,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vasicek  |first1=Oldrich |year=1976 |title=A Test for Normality Based on Sample Entropy |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=54–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically
:&lt;math&gt;h(\gamma) = \int_0^1 \log\,(Q'(p; \gamma))\,\mathrm dp = \log(\gamma)\,+\,\log(4\,\pi).\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
The Cauchy distribution is an example of a distribution which has no [[mean]], [[variance]] or higher [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] defined. Its [[mode (statistics)|mode]] and [[median]] are well defined and are both equal to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

When ''U'' and ''V'' are two independent [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]]s with [[expected value]] 0 and [[variance]] 1, then the ratio ''U''/''V'' has the standard Cauchy distribution.

If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[independent and identically distributed]] random variables, each with a standard Cauchy distribution, then the [[Arithmetic mean|sample mean]] (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+ ... +''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')/''n'' has the same standard Cauchy distribution. To see that this is true, compute the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the sample mean:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{\overline{X}}(t) = \mathrm{E}\left[e^{i\overline{X}t}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean. This example serves to show that the hypothesis of finite variance in the [[central limit theorem]] cannot be dropped. It is also an example of a more generalized version of the central limit theorem that is characteristic of all [[stable distribution]]s, of which the Cauchy distribution is a special case.

The Cauchy distribution is an [[infinitely divisible probability distribution]]. It is also a strictly [[stability (probability)|stable]] distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S.Kotz et al |year=2006 |title=Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences |page=778 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=978-0-471-15044-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard Cauchy distribution coincides with the [[Student's t-distribution]] with one degree of freedom.

Like all stable distributions, the [[location-scale family]] to which the Cauchy distribution belongs is closed under [[linear transformations]] with [[real number|real]] coefficients. In addition, the Cauchy distribution is the only univariate distribution which is closed under [[Möbius transformation|linear fractional transformations]] with real coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. B. Knight|title=A characterization of the Cauchy type|journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|volume = 55|year = 1976|pages= 130–135|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this connection, see also [[McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions]].

===Characteristic function===
Let ''X'' denote a Cauchy distributed random variable. The [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the Cauchy distribution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_X(t; x_0,\gamma) = \mathrm{E}\left[e^{iXt} \right ] =\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x;x_{0},\gamma)e^{ixt}\,dx =  e^{ix_0t - \gamma |t|}. &lt;/math&gt;

which is just the [[Fourier transform]] of the probability density. {{Citation needed|reason=Not exactly the definition of Fourier transform with a sign difference.|date=November 2012}} The original probability density may be expressed in terms of the characteristic function, essentially by using the inverse Fourier transform:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\gamma) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi_X(t;x_0,\gamma)e^{-ixt}\,dt \!&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that the characteristic function is not [[differentiable]] at the origin: this corresponds to the fact that the Cauchy distribution does not have an [[expected value]].

==Explanation of undefined moments==

===Mean===
If a [[probability distribution]] has a [[probability density function|density function]] ''f''(''x''), then the mean is
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty x f(x)\,dx. \qquad\qquad (1)\!&lt;/math&gt;

The question is now whether this is the same thing as
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x f(x)\,dx-\int_{-\infty}^0 |x| f(x)\,dx.\qquad\qquad (2) \!&lt;/math&gt;

If at most one of the two terms in (2) is infinite, then (1) is the same as (2). But in the case of the Cauchy distribution, both the positive and negative terms of (2) are infinite.  This means (2) is undefined. Moreover, if (1) is construed as a [[Lebesgue integral]], then (1) is also undefined, because (1) is then defined simply as the difference (2) between positive and negative parts.

However, if (1) is constructed as an [[improper integral]] rather than a Lebesgue integral, then (2) is undefined, and (1) is not necessarily [[well-defined]].  We may take (1) to mean
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{-a}^a x f(x)\,dx, \!&lt;/math&gt;

and this is its [[Cauchy principal value]], which is zero, but we could also take (1) to mean, for example,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{-2a}^a x f(x)\,dx, \!&lt;/math&gt;

which is ''not'' zero, as can be seen easily by computing the integral.

Because the integrand is bounded and is not Lebesgue integrable, it is not even [[Henstock–Kurzweil integral|Henstock–Kurzweil integrable]].  Various results in probability theory about [[expected value]]s, such as the [[strong law of large numbers]], will not work in such cases.

===Higher moments===
The Cauchy distribution does not have finite moments of any order.  Some of the higher [[raw moment]]s do exist and have a value of infinity, for example the raw second moment:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}[X^2] \propto \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {x^2 \over 1+x^2}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} 1-{x^2 \over 1+x^2}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {1 \over 1+x^2}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx-\pi = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

By re-arranging the formula, one can see that the second moment is essentially the infinite integral of a constant (here 1).  Higher even-powered raw moments will also evaluate to infinity.  Odd-powered raw moments, however, ''do not exist at all'' (i.e. are undefined), which is distinctly different from existing with the value of infinity. The odd-powered raw moments are undefined because their values are essentially equivalent to ∞ − ∞ since the two halves of the integral both diverge and have opposite signs.  The first raw moment is the mean, which, being odd, does not exist. (See also the discussion above about this.) This in turn means that all of the [[central moment]]s and [[standardized moment]]s do not exist (are undefined), since they are all based on the mean.  The variance — which is the second central moment — is likewise non-existent (despite the fact that the raw second moment exists with the value infinity).

The results for higher moments follow from [[Hölder's inequality]], which implies that higher moments (or halves of moments) diverge if lower ones do.

==Estimation of parameters ==
Because the parameters of the Cauchy distribution don't correspond to a mean and variance, attempting to estimate the parameters of the Cauchy distribution by using a sample mean and a sample variance will not succeed. For example, if ''n'' samples are taken from a Cauchy distribution, one may calculate the sample mean as:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt;

Although the sample values ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be concentrated about the central value ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the sample mean will become increasingly variable as more samples are taken, because of the increased likelihood of encountering sample points with a large absolute value. In fact, the distribution of the sample mean will be equal to the distribution of the samples themselves; i.e., the sample mean of a large sample is no better (or worse) an estimator of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; than any single observation from the sample.  Similarly, calculating the sample variance will result in values that grow larger as more samples are taken.

Therefore, more robust means of estimating the central value ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the scaling parameter γ are needed. One simple method is to take the median value of the sample as an estimator of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and half the sample [[interquartile range]] as an estimator of γ. Other, more precise and robust methods have been developed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cane |first1=Gwenda J. |year=1974 |title=Linear Estimation of Parameters of the Cauchy Distribution Based on Sample Quantiles |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=69 |issue=345 |pages= 243–245 |jstor=2285535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Jin |year=2010 |title=A Highly Efficient L-estimator for the Location Parameter of the Cauchy Distribution |journal=Computational Statistics |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=97–105 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/3p1430175v4806jq }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[truncated mean]] of the middle 24% of the sample [[order statistics]] produces an estimate for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; that is more efficient than using either the sample median or the full sample mean.&lt;ref name=rothenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothenberg |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Fisher|first2=Franklin, M.|last3=Tilanus|first3=C.B.|year=1966|volume=59|issue=306|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|title=A note on estimation from a Cauchy sample|pages=460&amp;ndash;463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=Daniel|year=1966|volume=61 |issue=316 |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|title=A note on the estimation of the location parameters of the Cauchy distribution|pages=852&amp;ndash;855|jstor=2282794}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the fat tails of the Cauchy distribution, the efficiency of the estimator decreases if more than 24% of the sample is used.&lt;ref name=rothenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt;

[[Maximum likelihood]] can also be used to estimate the parameters ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and γ. However, this tends to be complicated by the fact that this requires finding the roots of a high degree polynomial, and there can be multiple roots that represent local maxima.&lt;ref name=ferguson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas S. |year=1978 |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=73|issue=361|title=Maximum Likelihood Estimates of the Parameters of the Cauchy Distribution for Samples of Size 3 and 4|page=211|jstor=2286549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically efficient, it is relatively inefficient for small samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pitman estimator of the Cauchy location parameter|last1=Cohen Freue|first1=Gabriella V.|journal=Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference |volume=137 |year=2007|page=1901|url=http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/69424/USEPAP/Coushy%20dist.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The log-likelihood function for the Cauchy distribution for sample size n is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat\ell(\!x_0,\gamma|\,x_1,\dotsc,x_n) = n \log (\gamma) - \sum_{i=1}^n (\log [(\gamma)^2 + (x_i - \!x_0)^2]) - n \log (\pi)&lt;/math&gt;

Maximizing the log likelihood function with respect to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and γ produces the following system of equations:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i - x_0}{\gamma^2 + [x_i - \!x_0]^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma^2 + [x_i - x_0]^2} - \frac{n}{2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma^2 + [x_i - x_0]^2} &lt;/math&gt;

is a monotone function in γ and that the solution γ must satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; \min |x_i-x_0|\le \gamma\le \max |x_i-x_0|. &lt;/math&gt;

Solving just for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; requires solving a polynomial of degree 2''n''−1,&lt;ref name=ferguson/&gt; and solving just for γ requires solving a polynomial of degree ''n'' (first for γ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).  Therefore, whether solving for one parameter or for both parameters simultaneously, a [[numerical analysis|numerical]] solution on a computer is typically required. The benefit of maximum likelihood estimation is asymptotic efficiency; estimating ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; using the sample median is only about 81% as asymptotically efficient as estimating ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by maximum likelihood.&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=V.

==Circular Cauchy distribution==
If ''X'' is Cauchy distributed with median μ and scale parameter γ, then the complex variable

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{X - i}{X+i}&lt;/math&gt;

has unit modulus and is distributed on the unit circle with density:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{cc}(\theta;\zeta)= \frac{1}{2\pi } \frac{1 - |\zeta|^2}{|e^{i\theta} - \zeta|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

with respect to the angular variable θ = arg(''z''),{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} where

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{\psi - i}{\psi + i}&lt;/math&gt;

and ψ expresses the two parameters of the associated linear Cauchy distribution for ''x'' as a complex number:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi=\mu+i\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;

The distribution &lt;math&gt;P_{cc}(\theta;\zeta)&lt;/math&gt; is called the circular Cauchy distribution&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter McCullagh|McCullagh, P.]], [http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/79/2/247 &quot;Conditional inference and Cauchy models&quot;], ''[[Biometrika]]'', volume 79 (1992), pages 247&amp;ndash;259.

Mardia |year=1972 |title=Statistics of Directional Data |publisher=[[Academic Press]]}}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;(also the complex Cauchy distribution){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} with parameter ζ. The circular Cauchy distribution is related to the [[wrapped Cauchy distribution]]. If &lt;math&gt;P_{wc}(\theta;\psi)&lt;/math&gt; is a wrapped Cauchy distribution with the parameter ψ = μ + ''i'' γ representing the parameters of the corresponding &quot;unwrapped&quot; Cauchy distribution in the variable ''y'' where θ = ''y'' mod 2π, then

:&lt;math&gt;P_{wc}(\theta;\psi)=P_{cc}(\theta,e^{i\psi})\,&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions]] and [[Poisson kernel]] for related concepts.

The circular Cauchy distribution expressed in complex form has finite moments of all orders

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[Z^r] = \zeta^r,  \quad \operatorname{E}[\bar Z^r] = \bar\zeta^r&lt;/math&gt;

for integer ''r'' ≥ 1. For |φ| &lt; 1, the transformation

:&lt;math&gt;U(z, \phi) =  \frac{z - \phi}{1 - \bar \phi z}&lt;/math&gt;

is [[holomorphic]] on the unit disk, and the transformed variable ''U''(''Z'', φ) is distributed as complex Cauchy with parameter ''U''(ζ, φ).

Given a sample ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of size ''n'' &gt; 2, the maximum-likelihood equation

:&lt;math&gt;n^{-1} U \left(z, \hat\zeta \right) = n^{-1} \sum U \left(z_j, \hat\zeta \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

can be solved by a simple fixed-point iteration:

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta^{(r+1)} = U \left(n^{-1} U(z, \zeta^{(r)}), \, - \zeta^{(r)} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

starting with ζ&lt;sup&gt;(0)&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. The sequence of likelihood values is non-decreasing, and the solution is unique for samples containing at least three distinct values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J. Copas |year=1975 |title= On the unimodality of the likelihood function for the Cauchy distribution |journal=Biometrika |volume=62 |pages=701–704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum-likelihood estimate for the median (&lt;math&gt;\hat\mu&lt;/math&gt;) and scale parameter (&lt;math&gt;\hat\gamma&lt;/math&gt;) of a real Cauchy sample is obtained by the inverse transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat\mu \pm i\hat\gamma = i\frac{1+\hat\zeta}{1-\hat\zeta}.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''n'' ≤ 4, closed-form expressions are known for &lt;math&gt;\hat\zeta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=ferguson/&gt; The density of the maximum-likelihood estimator at ''t'' in the unit disk is necessarily of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{p_n(\chi(t, \zeta))}{(1 - |t|^2)^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\chi(t, \zeta) = \frac{ |t - \zeta|^2}{4(1 - |t|^2)(1 - |\zeta|^2)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Formulae for ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=P. McCullagh |year=1996 |title=Möbius transformation and Cauchy parameter estimation. |journal=Annals of Statistics |volume=24 |pages=786–808 |jstor = 2242674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multivariate Cauchy distribution==
A [[random vector]] {{nowrap|1=''X'' = (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)′}} is said to have the multivariate Cauchy distribution if every linear combination of its components ''Y'' = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' has a Cauchy distribution. That is, for any constant vector {{nowrap|''a'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the random variable {{nowrap|1=''Y'' = ''a′X''}} should have a univariate Cauchy distribution.&lt;ref name=ferg2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas S.|title=A Representation of the Symmetric Bivariate Cauchy Distribution|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume= |issue= |year=1962 |page=1256 |jstor=2237984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The characteristic function of a multivariate Cauchy distribution is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_X(t) =  e^{ix_0(t)-\gamma(t)}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') and γ(''t'') are real functions with ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') a [[homogeneous function]] of degree one and γ(''t'') a positive homogeneous function of degree one.&lt;ref name=ferg2/&gt;  More formally:&lt;ref name=ferg2/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_0(at) = ax_0(t),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma (at) = |a|\gamma (t),&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''t''.

An example of a bivariate Cauchy distribution can be given by:&lt;ref name=bivar&gt;{{cite journal|title=Non-linear Integral Equations to Approximate Bivariate Densities with Given Marginals and Dependence Function|last1=Molenberghs|first1=Geert|last2=Lesaffre|first2=Emmanuel|journal=Statistica Sinica |volume=7 |year=1997 |pages=713&amp;ndash;738| url=http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A7n310.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x, y; x_0,y_0,\gamma)= { 1 \over 2 \pi } \left[ { \gamma \over ((x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 +\gamma^2)^{1.5}  } \right] .&lt;/math&gt;
Note that in this example, even though there is no analogue to a covariance matrix, x and y are not [[Independence (probability theory)|statistically independent]].&lt;ref name=bivar/&gt;

Analogously to the univariate density, the multidimensional Cauchy density also relates to the [[multivariate Student distribution]]. They are equivalent when the degrees of freedom parameter is equal to one.  The density of a k dimension Student distribution with one degree of freedom becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;f({\mathbf x}; {\mathbf\mu},{\mathbf\Sigma}, k)= \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1+k}{2}\right)}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2})\pi^{\frac{k}{2}}\left|{\mathbf\Sigma}\right|^{\frac{1}{2}}\left[1+({\mathbf x}-{\mathbf\mu})^T{\mathbf\Sigma}^{-1}({\mathbf x}-{\mathbf\mu})\right]^{\frac{1+k}{2}}} .&lt;/math&gt;

Properties and details for this density can be obtained by taking it as a particular case of the multivariate Student density.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|320px|Control systems play a critical role in [[space flight]]]]

'''Control engineering''' or '''control systems engineering''' is the [[engineering]] discipline that applies [[control theory]] to design systems with desired behaviors.  The practice uses [[sensors]] to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements can be used to give [[feedback]] to the input [[actuators]] that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called [[automatic control]] (such as [[cruise control]] for regulating a car's speed). [[Multi-disciplinary]] in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by [[mathematical model]]ing of [[system]]s of a diverse range.

==Overview==
Modern day control engineering (also called control systems engineering) is a relatively new field of study that gained a significant attention during 20th century with the advancement in technology. It can be broadly defined or classified as practical application of [[control theory]]. Control engineering has an essential role in a wide range of control systems, from simple household washing machines to high-performance [[F-16]] fighter aircraft. It seeks to understand physical systems, using mathematical modeling, in terms of inputs, outputs and various components with different behaviors; use control systems design tools to develop [[Controller (control theory)|controller]]s for those systems; and implement controllers in physical systems employing available technology. A [[control system|system]] can be [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[fluid]], [[chemical]], [[finance|financial]] and even [[biology|biological]], and the mathematical modeling, analysis and controller design uses [[control theory]] in one or many of the [[Time domain|time]], [[frequency domain|frequency]] and [[S domain|complex-s]] domains, depending on the nature of the design problem.

== History ==

Automatic control systems were first developed over two thousand years ago. The first feedback control device on record is thought to be the ancient [[Ktesibios]]'s [[water clock]] in [[Alexandria]], Egypt around the third century B.C. It kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and, therefore, the water flow from that vessel. This certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in Baghdad when the Mongols [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|captured]] the city in 1258 A.D. A variety of automatic devices have been used over the centuries to accomplish useful tasks or simply to just entertain. The latter includes the automata, popular in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, featuring dancing figures that would repeat the same task over and over again; these automata are examples of open-loop control. Milestones among feedback, or &quot;closed-loop&quot; automatic control devices, include the temperature regulator of a furnace attributed to Drebbel, circa 1620, and the centrifugal flyball governor used for regulating the speed of steam engines by James Watt in 1788.

In his 1868 paper &quot;On Governors&quot;, J. C. Maxwell (who discovered the Maxwell electromagnetic field equations) was able to explain instabilities exhibited by the flyball governor using differential equations to describe the control system. This demonstrated the importance and usefulness of mathematical models and methods in understanding complex phenomena, and signaled the beginning of mathematical control and systems theory. Elements of control theory had appeared earlier but not as dramatically and convincingly as in Maxwell's analysis.

Control theory made significant strides in the next 100 years. New mathematical techniques made it possible to control, more accurately, significantly more complex dynamical systems than the original flyball governor. These techniques include developments in optimal control in the 1950s and 1960s, followed by progress in stochastic, robust, adaptive and optimal control methods in the 1970s and 1980s. Applications of control methodology have helped make possible space travel and communication satellites, safer and more efficient aircraft, cleaner auto engines, cleaner and more efficient chemical processes, to mention but a few.

Before it emerged as a unique discipline, control engineering was practiced as a part of mechanical engineering and control theory was studied as a part of [[electrical engineering]], since [[electrical circuits]] can often be easily described using control theory techniques. In the very first control relationships, a current output was represented with a voltage control input. However, not having proper technology to implement electrical control systems, designers left with the option of less efficient and slow responding mechanical systems. A very effective mechanical controller that is still widely used in some hydro plants is the [[Centrifugal governor|governor]]. Later on, previous to modern [[power electronics]], process control systems for industrial applications were devised by mechanical engineers using [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] and [[Hydraulic system|hydraulic]] control devices, many of which are still in use today.

== Control theory ==
{{main|Control theory}}

There are two major divisions in control theory, namely, classical and modern, which have direct implications over the control engineering applications. The scope of classical control theory is limited to [[Single-Input and Single-Output|single-input and single-output]] (SISO) system design, except when analyzing for disturbance rejection using a second input. The system analysis is carried out in the time domain using [[differential equations]], in the complex-s domain with the [[Laplace transform]], or in the frequency domain by transforming from the complex-s domain. Many systems may be assumed to have a second order and single variable system response in the time domain. A controller designed using classical theory often requires on-site tuning due to incorrect design approximations. Yet, due to the easier physical implementation of classical controller designs as compared to systems designed using modern control theory, these controllers are preferred in most industrial applications. The most common controllers designed using classical control theory are [[PID controller]]s. A less common implementation may include either a Lead or Lag filter and at times both. The ultimate end goal is to meet a requirements set typically provided in the time-domain called the Step response, or at times in the frequency domain called the Open-Loop response. The Step response characteristics applied in a specification are typically percent overshoot, settling time, etc. The Open-Loop response characteristics applied in a specification are typically Gain and Phase margin and bandwidth. These characteristics may be evaluated through simulation including a dynamic model of the system under control coupled with the compensation model.

In contrast, modern control theory is carried out in the [[state space (controls)|state space]], and can deal with multi-input and multi-output ([[MIMO]]) systems. This overcomes the limitations of classical control theory in more sophisticated design problems, such as fighter aircraft control, with the limitation that no frequency domain analysis is possible. In modern design, a system is represented to the greatest advantage as a set of decoupled first order [[differential equation]]s defined using [[state variables]]. [[Nonlinear control|Nonlinear]], [[multivariable control|multivariable]], [[adaptive control|adaptive]] and [[robust control]] theories come under this division. Matrix methods are significantly limited for MIMO systems where linear independence cannot be assured in the relationship between inputs and outputs. Being fairly new, modern control theory has many areas yet to be explored. Scholars like [[Rudolf E. Kalman]] and [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] are well-known among the people who have shaped modern control theory.

== Control systems ==
Control engineering is the engineering [[discipline]] that focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic systems]] (e.g. [[mechanics|mechanical]] [[system]]s) and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controller]]s that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.  Although such controllers need not be electrical many are and hence control engineering is often viewed as a subfield of electrical engineering.  However, the falling price of microprocessors is making the actual implementation of a control system essentially trivial{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.  As a result, focus is shifting back to the mechanical and process engineering discipline, as intimate knowledge of the physical system being controlled is often desired.

[[Electrical circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s and [[microcontroller]]s can all be used to implement [[Control system]]s. Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s.

In most of the cases, control engineers utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. This is often accomplished using a [[PID controller]] system. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system, which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[torque]] accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback. In practically all such systems [[stability theory|stability]] is important and control theory can help ensure stability is achieved.

Although feedback is an important aspect of control engineering, control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback. This is known as [[open loop control]]. A classic example of [[open loop control]] is a [[washing machine]] that runs through a pre-determined cycle without the use of [[sensor]]s.

== Control engineering education ==
At many universities, control engineering courses are taught in [[electrical engineering|Electrical]] and [[Electronic Engineering]], [[Mechatronics Engineering]], [[Mechanical engineering]], and [[Aerospace engineering]]; in others it is connected to [[computer science]], as most control techniques today are implemented through computers, often as [[embedded systems]] (as in the automotive field). The field of control within [[chemical engineering]] is often known as [[process control]]. It deals primarily with the control of variables in a chemical process in a plant. It is taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of any chemical engineering program, and employs many of the same principles in control engineering. Other engineering disciplines also overlap with control engineering, as it can be applied to any system for which a suitable model can be derived. However, specialised control engineering departments do exist, for example the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at the University of Sheffield.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Control engineering has diversified applications that include science, finance management, and even human behavior.  Students of control engineering may start with a linear control system course dealing with the time and complex-s domain, which requires a thorough background in elementary mathematics and [[Laplace transform]] (called classical control theory).  In linear control, the student does frequency and time domain analysis.  [[Digital control]] and [[nonlinear control]] courses require [[z transform]]ation and algebra respectively, and could be said to complete a basic control education. From here onwards there are several sub branches.

== Recent advancement ==
Originally, control engineering was all about continuous systems. Development of computer control tools posed a requirement of discrete control system engineering because the communications between the computer-based digital controller and the physical system are governed by a [[computer clock]]. The equivalent to [[Laplace transform]] in the discrete domain is the [[z-transform]]. Today many of the control systems are computer controlled and they consist of both digital and analog components.

Therefore, at the design stage either digital components are mapped into the continuous domain and the design is carried out in the continuous domain, or analog components are mapped into discrete domain and design is carried out there. The first of these two methods is more commonly encountered in practice because many industrial systems have many continuous systems components, including mechanical, fluid, biological and analog electrical components, with a few digital controllers.

Similarly, the design technique has progressed from paper-and-ruler based manual design to [[computer-aided design]], and now to [[computer-automated design]] (CAutoD), which has been made possible by [[evolutionary computation]].  CAutoD can be applied not just to tuning a predefined control scheme, but also to controller structure optimisation, system identification and invention of novel control systems, based purely upon a performance requirement, independent of any specific control scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, K.C. and Li, Y.

'''Chagas disease''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|g|ə|s|}}; {{lang-pt|doença de Chagas}} {{IPA-pt|duˈẽsɐ dʒi ˈʃagɐʃ|}}, {{lang-es|enfermedad de Chagas}} {{IPA-es|eɱfermeˈðað ðe ˈtʃaɣas|}}, also known as ''mal de Chagas''[-''Mazza''] in both languages; also called '''American trypanosomiasis''') is a [[tropical disease|tropical]] [[parasitic disease]] caused by the [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]n ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]''. ''T. cruzi'' is commonly transmitted to humans and other mammals by an insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], the [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] &quot;kissing bugs&quot; of the subfamily [[Triatominae]] (family [[Reduviidae]]), most commonly from species belonging to the ''[[Triatoma]]'', ''[[Rhodnius]]'', and ''[[Panstrongylus]]'' genera.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

The disease may also be spread through [[blood transfusion]] and [[organ transplantation]], ingestion of food contaminated with [[Parasitism|parasites]], and [[vertical transmission|from a mother to her fetus]].&lt;ref name=emed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/214581-overview |title=Chagas Disease (American Trypanosomiasis) |author=Louis V Kirchhoff |coauthors= |date=17 December 2010 |work=|publisher=eMedicine |accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of Chagas disease vary over the course of an infection. In the early, acute stage, symptoms are mild and usually produce no more than local swelling at the site of infection. The initial acute phase is responsive to [[antiparasitic]] treatments, with 60–90% cure rates. After 4–8 weeks, individuals with active infections enter the chronic phase of Chagas disease, which is asymptomatic for 60–80% of chronically infected individuals through their lifetime.&lt;ref name=Bern&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bern C, Montgomery SP, Herwaldt BL, ''et al.'' |title=Evaluation and treatment of chagas disease in the United States: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=298 |issue=18 |pages=2171–81 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=18000201 |doi=10.1001/jama.298.18.2171 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18000201|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rassi A, Rassi A, Marin-Neto JA |title=Chagas disease |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9723 |pages=1388–402 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20399979 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60061-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(10)60061-X|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rassi A, Dias JC, Marin-Neto JA, Rassi A |title=Challenges and opportunities for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of Chagas' disease |journal=Heart |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=524–34 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19131444 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2008.159624 |url=http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19131444|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antiparasitic treatments also appear to delay or prevent the development of disease symptoms during the chronic phase of the disease, but 20–40% of chronically infected individuals will still eventually develop life-threatening heart and digestive system disorders. The currently available antiparasitic treatments for Chagas disease are [[benznidazole]] and [[nifurtimox]], which can cause temporary side effects in many patients including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bern&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rassi1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rassi2&quot;/&gt;

Chagas disease is contracted primarily in the Americas, particularly in poor, rural areas of [[Mexico]], Central America, and South America; very rarely, the disease has been found in the Southern United States. The insects that spread the disease are known by various local names, including ''vinchuca'' in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, ''barbeiro'' (the [[barber surgeon|barber]]) in Brazil, ''pito'' in Colombia, ''chinche'' in Central America, ''chipo'' in Venezuela, ''chupança'', ''chinchorro'', and &quot;the kissing bug&quot;.

It is estimated that as many as 11 million people in Mexico, Central America and South America have Chagas disease, most of whom do not know they are infected. Large-scale population movements from rural to urban areas of Latin America and to other regions of the world have increased the geographic distribution of Chagas disease, and cases have been noted in many countries, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref name=Rassi1/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roca2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The human disease occurs in two stages: an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] stage, which occurs shortly after an initial [[infection]], and a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] stage that develops over many years.

The acute phase lasts for the first few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or exhibits only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a [[chagoma]]) where the parasite entered the body.&lt;ref name=Guimaraes1968&gt;{{cite journal | author=Guimarães FN, da Silva NN, Clausell DT, de Mello AL, Rapone T, Snell T, Rodrigues N| title=Um surto epidêmico de doença de Chagas de provável transmissão digestiva, ocorrido em Teutonia (Estrêla&amp;nbsp;– Rio Grande Do Sul) | journal=Hospital (Rio J) | volume=73 | issue=6 | pages=1767–804| year=1968 |url=http://en.calameo.com/read/00000948401a1fdb85f76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recognized marker of acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes swelling of the eyelids on the side of the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle ([[myocarditis]]) or brain ([[meningoencephalitis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Guimaraes1968&quot;/&gt; The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

If symptoms develop during the acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within three to eight weeks in approximately 90% of individuals.&lt;ref name=Bern/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi1/&gt; Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called ''indeterminate'' chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called ''determinate'' chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.&lt;ref name=Bern/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi1/&gt;

The symptomatic (determinate) chronic stage affects the [[nervous system]], [[digestive system]] and [[Human heart|heart]]. About two-thirds of people with chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop [[digestive system]] damage, resulting in dilation of the [[digestive tract]] ([[megacolon]] and [[megaesophagus]]), accompanied by severe [[weight loss]]. [[Swallowing]] difficulties (secondary [[achalasia]]) may be the first symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;

20% to 50% of individuals with intestinal involvement also exhibit cardiac involvement.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt; Up to 10% of chronically infected individuals develop [[neuritis]] that results in altered tendon reflexes and sensory impairment. Isolated cases exhibit central nervous system involvement, including [[dementia]], confusion, chronic [[encephalopathy]] and [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory]] and [[Motor skill|motor]] deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Córdova E, Maiolo E, Corti M, Orduña T |title=Neurological manifestations of Chagas' disease |journal=Neurol. Res. |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=238–44 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20406601 |doi=10.1179/016164110X12644252260637 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical manifestations of Chagas disease are due to cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an [[inflammatory response]], cellular [[lesions]], and [[fibrosis]]. For example, intracellular [[amastigote]]s destroy the intramural neurons of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart [[aneurysm]]s, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;

==Transmission==
[[File:Rhodnius prolixus70-300.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]'' is the principal vector in [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], and some parts of [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]].]]

In Chagas-endemic areas, the main mode of transmission is through an insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] called a [[Triatominae|triatomine]] bug.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; A triatomine becomes infected with ''T. cruzi'' by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs. The bugs emerge at night, when the inhabitants are sleeping. Because they tend to feed on people's faces, triatomine bugs are also known as &quot;kissing bugs&quot;. After they bite and ingest blood, they defecate on the person. Triatomines pass ''T. cruzi'' parasites (called [[trypomastigote]]s) in feces left near the site of the bite wound.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

Scratching the site of the bite causes the trypomastigotes to enter the host through the wound, or through intact [[mucous membranes]], such as the [[conjunctiva]]. Once inside the host, the trypomastigotes invade cells, where they differentiate into intracellular [[amastigote]]s. The amastigotes multiply by [[binary fission]] and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are then released into the bloodstream. This cycle is repeated in each newly infected cell. Replication resumes only when the parasites enter another cell or are ingested by another vector.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; (See also: [[:Image:Trypanosoma cruzi LifeCycle.gif|Life cycle and transmission of ''T. cruzi'']])

Dense vegetation (such as that of tropical [[rainforest]]s) and urban habitats are not ideal for the establishment of the human transmission cycle. However, in regions where the [[sylvatic]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly [[deforestation|deforested]] areas, [[piassava palm]] culture areas, and some parts of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Teixeira AR, Monteiro PS, Rebelo JM |title=Emerging Chagas disease: trophic network and cycle of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi from palm trees in the Amazon |journal=Emerging Infect Dis |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=100–12 |year=2001 |pmid=11266300 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no1/teixeira.htm |doi=10.3201/eid0701.010115 |pmc=2631687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''T. cruzi'' can also be transmitted through [[blood transfusions]]. With the exception of blood derivatives (such as fractionated [[antibodies]]), all blood components are infective. The parasite remains viable at 4°C for at least 18 days or up to 250 days when kept at room temperature. It is unclear whether ''T. cruzi'' can be transmitted through frozen-thawed blood components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wendel S |title=Transfusion transmitted Chagas disease: Is it really under control? |journal=Acta Trop |volume= 115|issue= 1–2|pages= 28–34|year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20044970 |doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.12.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001-706X(09)00386-6 |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modes of transmission include [[organ transplant]]ation, through [[breast milk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Santos Ferreira C, Amato Neto V, Gakiya E, Bezerra RC, Alarcón RS |title=Microwave treatment of human milk to prevent transmission of Chagas disease |journal=[[Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo]] |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=41–2 |year=2003 |pmid=12751321 |doi=10.1590/S0036-46652003000100008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by accidental laboratory exposure. Chagas disease can also be spread congenitally (from a pregnant woman to her baby) through the [[placenta]], and accounts for approximately 13% of stillborn deaths in parts of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hudson L, Turner MJ |title=Immunological consequences of infection and vaccination in South American trypanosomiasis [and discussion] |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=307 |issue=1131 |pages=51–61 |year=1984 |month=November |pmid=6151688 |jstor=2990154 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1984.0108|bibcode = 1984RSPTB.307...51H }} Retrieved 22 February 2007 through [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral transmission is an unusual route of infection, but has been described.

Chagas disease is a growing problem in Europe, because the majority of cases with chronic infection are asymptomatic and because of migration from Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roca2011&quot;/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The presence of ''T. cruzi'' is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It can be detected by [[microscope|microscopic]] examination of fresh anti[[coagulate]]d blood, or its [[buffy coat]], for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]], for direct visualization of [[parasitism|parasites]]. Microscopically, ''T. cruzi'' can be confused with ''[[Trypanosoma rangeli]]'', which is not known to be [[pathogen]]ic in humans. Isolation of ''T. cruzi'' can occur by inoculation into [[mouse|mice]], by culture in specialized media (for example, NNN, LIT); and by [[xenodiagnosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brumpt E| title=Le xénodiagnostic.

Various [[immunoassay]]s for ''T. cruzi'' are available and can be used to distinguish among [[Strain (biology)|strains]] ([[zymodeme]]s of ''T.cruzi'' with divergent pathogenicities). These tests include: detecting [[complement fixation]], indirect [[hemagglutination]], indirect [[fluorescence]] assays, [[radioimmunoassay]]s, and [[ELISA]]. Alternatively, diagnosis and strain identification can be made using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).&lt;ref name= emed/&gt;

[[Blood transfusion]] was formerly the second-most common mode of transmission for Chagas disease, but the development and implementation of [[blood bank]] screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the last decade. [[Blood donation]]s in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Castro E |title=Chagas' disease: lessons from routine donation testing |journal=Transfus Med |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=16–23 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19302451 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3148.2009.00915.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0958-7578&amp;date=2009&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=16|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gascon&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gascon J, Bern C, Pinazo MJ |title=Chagas disease in Spain, the United States and other non-endemic countries |journal=Acta Trop. |volume= 115|issue= 1–2|pages= 22–7|year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19646412 |doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.07.019 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001-706X(09)00199-5|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.&lt;ref name=Gascon/&gt;

==Management==
There are two approaches to treating Chagas disease, [[antiparasitic]] treatment, to kill the parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection.
Management of Chagasic  disease uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.

===Medication===
Antiparasitic treatment is most effective early in the course of infection, but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include [[azole]] or [[Nitro compound|nitro]] derivatives, such as [[benznidazole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garcia S, Ramos CO, Senra JF |title=Treatment with Benznidazole during the Chronic Phase of Experimental Chagas' Disease Decreases Cardiac Alterations |journal=[[Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|Antimicrob Agents Chemother]] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=1521–8 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15793134 |pmc=1068607 |doi=10.1128/AAC.49.4.1521-1528.2005 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15793134}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[nifurtimox]]. Both agents are limited in their capacity to effect parasitologic cure (a complete elimination of ''T. cruzi'' from the body), especially in chronically infected patients, and resistance to these drugs has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buckner FS, Wilson AJ, White TC, Van Voorhis WC |title=Induction of Resistance to Azole Drugs in Trypanosoma cruzi |journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=3245–50 |year=1998 |month=December |pmid=9835521 |pmc=106029 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9835521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies suggest antiparasitic treatment leads to parasitological cure in about 60–85% of adults and more than 90% of infants treated in the first year of acute phase Chagas disease. Children (aged six to 12 years) with chronic disease have a cure rate of about 60% with benznidazole. While the rate of cure declines the longer an adult has been infected with Chagas, treatment with benznidazole has been shown to slow the onset of heart disease in adults with chronic Chagas infections.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi1/&gt;

Treatment of chronic infection in women prior to or during pregnancy does not appear to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant. Likewise, it is unclear whether [[prophylactic]] treatment of chronic infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression (for example, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already immunosuppressed (for example, those with HIV infection).&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;

===Complications===
In the chronic stage, treatment involves managing the clinical manifestations of the disease. For example, [[pacemaker]]s and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug [[amiodarone]], may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dubner S, Schapachnik E, Riera AR, Valero E |title=Chagas disease: state-of-the-art of diagnosis and management |journal=Cardiol J |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=493–504 |year=2008 |pmid=19039752}}&lt;/ref&gt; while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for [[heart transplantation]] surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a [[contraindication]] for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the [[immunosuppression]] that follows surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bocchi EA, Bellotti G, Mocelin AO |title=Heart transplantation for chronic Chagas' heart disease |journal=Ann Thorac Surg |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1727–33 |year=1996 |month=June |pmid=8651775 |doi=10.1016/0003-4975(96)00141-5 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0003-4975(96)00141-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was noted that survival rates in Chagas patients could be significantly improved by using lower dosages of the immunosuppressant drug [[ciclosporin]].

[[File:Distribution of Chagas' disease.svg|thumb|Chagas disease in Latin America ([[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] zones)]]
Chagas disease affects 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;million people living in endemic Latin American countries, with an additional 300,000–400,000 living in nonendemic countries, including Spain and the United States. An estimated 41,200 new cases occur annually in endemic countries, and 14,400 infants are born with congenital Chagas disease annually.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi1/&gt; in 2010 it resulted in approximately 10,300 deaths up from 9,300 in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095-128|pmid=23245604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disease is present in 18 countries on the American continents, ranging from the southern United States to northern [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Centers for Disease Control (CDC) |url= http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/TrypanosomiasisAmerican.htm |title=DPDx&amp;nbsp;– Trypanosomiasis, American. Fact Sheet |accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chagas exists in two different ecological zones. In the [[Southern Cone]] region, the main vector lives in and around human homes. In Central America and Mexico, the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas. In both zones, Chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas, where triatomines breed and feed on the over 150 species from 24 families of domestic and wild mammals, as well as humans, that are the [[natural reservoir]]s of ''T. cruzi''.&lt;ref name=NatRev&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morel CM, Lazdins J |title=Chagas disease |journal=Nat Rev Microbiol |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=14–5 |year=2003|month=October |pmid=15040175 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds appear to be immune to infection and therefore are not considered to be a ''T. cruzi'' reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals that are part of the ancient, [[sylvatic]] (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=Pinto-Dias JC | year = 1992 | title = Epidemiology of Chagas disease | conference = ISBT Brazil '92.

The primary wildlife reservoirs for ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' in the United States include [[opossum]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[woodrat]]s, and [[mice]].&lt;ref name=Karsten92/&gt; Opossums are particularly important as reservoirs, because the parasite can complete its life cycle in the anal glands of the animal without having to re-enter the insect vector.&lt;ref name=Karsten92&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karsten V, Davis C, Kuhn R |title=''Trypanosoma cruzi'' in wild raccoons and opossums in North Carolina |journal=J Parasitol |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=547–9 |year=1992 |month=June |pmid=1597808 |doi=10.2307/3283667 |jstor=3283667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recorded prevalence of the disease in opossums in the U.S. ranges from 8.3%&lt;ref name=Karsten92/&gt; to 37.5%.&lt;ref name=Barr91&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barr SC, Brown CC, Dennis VA, Klei TR |title=The lesions and prevalence of ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' in opossums and armadillos from southern Louisiana |journal=J Parasitol |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=624–7 |year=1991 |month=August |pmid=1907654 |doi=10.2307/3283170 |jstor=3283170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic Chagas disease remains a major health problem in many Latin American countries, despite the effectiveness of hygienic and preventive measures, such as eliminating the transmitting insects. However, several landmarks have been achieved in the fight against it in Latin America, including a reduction by 72% of the incidence of human infection in children and young adults in the countries of the [[Southern Cone]] Initiative, and at least three countries ([[Uruguay]], in 1997, and [[Chile]], in 1999, and Brazil in 2006) have been certified free of vectorial and transfusional transmission.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;&lt;ref name= TDR1&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.who.int/tdrold/publications/tdrnews/news65/chagas.htm |title=The Southern Cone Initiative: an update |work=Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) |publisher=WHO|year=2004|accessdate=29 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=May 2012|bot=BlevintronBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18053273&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Massad E |title=The elimination of Chagas' disease from Brazil |journal=Epidemiol Infect |volume=136 |issue=9 |pages=1153–64 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18053273 |doi=10.1017/S0950268807009879 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0950268807009879 |pmc=2870925}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, vectorial transmission has been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces,&lt;ref name= TDR1/&gt; and major progress toward this goal has also been made in both Paraguay and Bolivia.

He discovered that the intestines of Triatomidae (now [[Reduviidae]]: [[Triatominae]]) harbored a flagellate protozoan, a new species of the ''[[Trypanosoma]]'' genus, and was able to prove experimentally that it could be transmitted to [[marmoset]] monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Later studies showed [[squirrel monkey]]s were also vulnerable to infection.&lt;ref name=Hulsebos_1989&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hulsebos LH, Choromanski L, Kuhn RE |title=The effect of interleukin-2 on parasitemia and myocarditis in experimental Chagas' disease |journal=J Protozool |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=293–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2499678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chagas named the pathogenic parasite as ''Trypanosoma cruzi''&lt;ref name=Chagas_1909 /&gt; and later that year as ''Schizotrypanum cruzi'',&lt;ref name=Chagas_1909b /&gt; both honoring [[Oswaldo Cruz]], the noted Brazilian physician and [[epidemiologist]] who successfully fought epidemics of [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], and [[bubonic plague]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and other cities in the beginning of the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus ''[[Pneumocystis pneumonia|Pneumocystis]]'', later infamously linked to PCP (''Pneumocystis'' [[pneumonia]] in AIDS victims).&lt;ref name=Redhead_2006 /&gt; Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus ''Schizotrypanum'', but following the description of ''Pneumocystis'' by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name ''Trypanosoma cruzi''.

In [[Argentina]], the disease is known as ''mal de Chagas-Mazza'', in honor of [[Salvador Mazza]], the [[Argentina|Argentine]] physician who in 1926 began investigating the disease and over the years became the principal researcher of this disease in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drwebsa.com.ar/alcha/hist4.htm |publisher=Asociación Lucha Contra el Mal de Chagas |title=Enfermedad de Chagas&amp;nbsp;– Mazza |language=Spanish |accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' in Argentina in 1927, eventually leading to support from local and European medical schools and Argentine government policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm |title=Historia de la enfermedad de Chagas |language=Spanish|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091204113113/http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm |archivedate=4 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hypothesized that [[Charles Darwin]] might have suffered from Chagas disease as a result of a bite of the so-called great black bug of the [[Pampas]] (''vinchuca'') (see [[Charles Darwin's illness]]). The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of [[the Voyage of the Beagle]] as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the [[Andes]] near [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near [[Valparaiso]], but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of [[symptom]]s, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at [[Westminster Abbey]] by using modern [[PCR]] techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's [[curator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adler D |title=Darwin's Illness |journal=Isr J Med Sci |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=218–21 |year=1989 |pmid=2496051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christiaan Neethling Barnard''' (8 November 1922 – 2 September 2001) was a South African [[cardiothoracic surgery|cardiac surgeon]] who performed the world's first successful human-to-human [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]].

== Early life ==
Barnard grew up in [[Beaufort West]], [[Cape Province]], [[Union of South Africa]]. His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa|Dutch Reformed Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;&gt;[[Donald McRae (author)|McRae, D.]] (2007). ''Every Second Counts''. Berkley.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his four brothers, Abraham, died of a heart problem at the age of five. Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the [[University of Cape Town]] [[Medical School]], where he obtained his [[MBChB|MB ChB]] in 1945.

==Career==
Barnard did his [[internship (medicine)|internship]] and [[residency (medicine)|residency]] at the [[Groote Schuur Hospital]] in [[Cape Town]], after which he worked as a general practitioner in [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres]], a rural town in the [[Cape Province]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at the Groote Schuur Hospital as a registrar.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; He completed his Masters degree, receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the [[University of Cape Town]]. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the same university for a dissertation entitled &quot;The treatment of tuberculous meningitis&quot;.

In 1956, he received a two-year scholarship for postgraduate training in [[cardiothoracic surgery]] at the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Minneapolis]], United States under open-heart surgery pioneer [[C. Walton Lillehei|Walt Lillehei]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation pioneer [[Norman Shumway]], who along with [[Richard Lower (surgeon)|Richard Lower]] did much of the pioneering research leading to the first human heart transplant.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; In 1958 he received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis entitled, &quot;The [[aortic valve]] – problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; The same year he was awarded Doctor of Philosophy degree for his dissertation entitled &quot;The aetiology of congenital intestinal [[atresia]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; Barnard described the two years he spent in the US as &quot;the most fascinating time in my life.&quot;

Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed cardiothoracic surgeon at the Groote Schuur Hospital, establishing the hospital's first heart unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; He was promoted to full-time lecturer and Director of Surgical Research at the University of Cape Town. Three years later he was appointed Head of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the teaching hospitals of the University of Cape Town. He rose to the position of Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1962. Barnard's younger brother Marius, who also studied medicine, eventually became Barnard's right-hand man at the department of Cardiac Surgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; Over time, Barnard became known as a brilliant surgeon with many contributions to the treatment of cardiac diseases, such as the [[Tetralogy of Fallot]] and [[Ebstein's anomaly]]. He was promoted to Professor of Surgical Science in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1972. Among the many awards he received over the years, he was named [[Professor Emeritus]] in 1984.

== The first successful heart transplant ==
Following the first successful [[kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] in 1953, in the United States, Barnard performed the second kidney transplant in South Africa in October 1967, the first being done in Johannesburg the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marius|last=Barnard|title=Defining Moments}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2008 |title=Flesh and Blood: Organ Transplantation and Blood Transfusion in Twentieth-Century America |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JaZn25Uv6XwC&amp;dq=flesh+and+blood&amp;cad=0 |first=Susan E. |last=Lederer |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=174 |isbn=978-0-19-516150-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard experimented for several years with animal heart transplants.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; More than 50 dogs received transplanted hearts.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily_I&quot;&gt;{{cite news|date=29 November 1987 |title=Memories of the Heart |work=Daily Intelligencer |location=Doylestown, Pennsylvania |page=A-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the availability of new breakthroughs introduced by several pioneers, amongst them [[Norman Shumway]], several surgical teams were in a position to prepare for a human heart transplant.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; Barnard had a patient willing to undergo the procedure, but as with other surgeons, he needed a suitable donor.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily_I&quot; /&gt;

He performed the world's first human heart transplant operation on 3 December 1967, in an operation assisted by his brother, [[Marius Barnard (surgeon)|Marius Barnard]]; the operation lasted nine hours and used a team of thirty people.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; The patient, [[Louis Washkansky]], was a 54-year-old grocer, suffering from [[diabetes]] and incurable [[heart disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily_I&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; Barnard later wrote, &quot;For a dying man it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side.&quot; The donor heart came from a young woman, [[Denise Darvall]], who had been rendered brain damaged in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; After securing permission from Darvall's father to use her heart, Barnard performed the transplant. Rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother, Dr. Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; Twenty years later, Dr. Marius Barnard recounted, &quot;Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily_I&quot; /&gt; Washkansky survived the operation and lived for 18 days. However, he succumbed to [[pneumonia]] as he was taking [[immunosuppressive drug]]s. Though the first patient with the heart of another human being survived for only a little more than two weeks, Barnard had passed a milestone in a new field of life-extending surgery.

Barnard became an international superstar overnight and was celebrated around the world for his daring accomplishment. He was quite [[photogenic]], and enjoyed the media attention following the operation. Barnard continued to perform heart transplants. A transplant operation was conducted on 2 January 1968, and the patient, [[Philip Blaiberg]], survived for 19 months.  Dirk van Zyl, who received a new heart in 1971, was the longest-lived recipient, surviving over 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=7 July 1994 |title=Dirk van Zyl, 68; Had '71 Transplant |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/obituaries/dirk-van-zyl-68-had-71-transplant.html |work=New York Times |accessdate=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnard performed ten [[Heart transplantation#Orthotopic procedure|orthotopic]] transplants (1967–1973). He was also the first to perform a [[Heart transplantation#Heterotopic procedure|heterotopic]] heart transplant, an operation that he himself devised. Forty-nine consecutive heterotopic heart transplants were performed in Cape Town between 1975 and 1984.

When many surgeons—disillusioned by poor results—gave up cardiac transplantation, Barnard persisted until the advent of [[ciclosporin]], which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He was also the first surgeon to attempt [[xenograft]] transplantation in a human patient, while attempting to save the life of a young girl unable to leave artificial life support after a second aortic valve replacement. He was later accused of wrongdoing by her parents.

== Public life ==
After his first successful heart transplant Barnard became known as the &quot;film star surgeon&quot;. He was loved by his patients throughout the world, hundreds of whom were treated free of charge, and hated by many others who were jealous of his instant success. He was accused by some colleagues in the profession of &quot;stealing&quot; the idea and the opportunity to perform the first heart transplant. Often considered a spoiled and arrogant personality, he was also regarded as kind and considerate by others. Because of his widely publicised love affairs, he became jokingly known as &quot;doctor of hearts&quot;, referring to the heart as an emotional symbol rather than in its usual medical context. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Barnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africa's laws of [[apartheid]], and was not afraid to criticise his nation's government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent to travel abroad. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame to campaign for a change in the law. Christiaan's brother, Dr. [[Marius Barnard (surgeon)|Marius Barnard]], went into politics, and was elected to the legislature on an anti-apartheid platform. Barnard later stated that the reason he never won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was probably because he was a &quot;[[white South African]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1422/14220850.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Barnard's first marriage was to Aletta Gertruida Louw, a nurse, whom he married in 1948 while practising medicine in [[Ceres, South Africa|Ceres]]. The couple had two children: Deirdre (born 1950) and Andre (1951–1984).&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/christiaan-barnard-celebrated-pioneer-of-heart-transplant-surgery-dies-aged-78-667863.html Christiaan Barnard, celebrated pioneer of heart transplant surgery, dies aged 78]&quot;, ''The Independent'', 3 September 2001. Retrieved 18 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; International fame took a toll on his personal life, and in 1969, Barnard and his wife divorced. In 1970, he married heiress Barbara Zoellner when she was 19, and they had two children: Frederick (born 1972) and Christiaan Jr. (born 1974).&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio&gt;{{cite web |title=Christiaan Barnard Biography |url=http://www.allsands.com/entertainment/people/christiaanbarna_aoi_gn.htm |accessdate=10 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He divorced Zoellner in 1982.&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio/&gt; Barnard married for a third time in 1988 to Karin Setzkorn, a young model.&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio/&gt; They also had two children: Armin (born 1990) and Lara (born 1997), but this last marriage also ended in divorce in 2000.&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio/&gt;

Barnard had many extramarital affairs, including with film stars [[Uta Levka]] and [[Gina Lollabrigida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; He also allegedly had relations with many others, including [[Françoise Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Celebrity Surgeon: Christiaan Barnard – A Life|first=Chris|last=Logan|publisher=[[Jonathan Ball Publishers]]|year=2004|isbn=1-86842-163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retirement ==
Barnard retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing [[rheumatoid arthritis]] in his hands which precluded his surgical career. He struggled with arthritis since 1956, when it was diagnosed during his postgraduate work in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrae2007&quot;/&gt; After retirement, he spent two years as the Scientist-In-Residence at the Oklahoma Transplantation Institute in the US, and an acting consultant for various institutions.

He had by this time become very interested in anti-aging research, and his reputation suffered in 1986 when he promoted ''[[Glycel]]'', an expensive &quot;anti-aging&quot; skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] soon thereafter.{{Verify source|date=June 2007}} He also spent time as a research advisor to the Clinique la Prairie, in [[Switzerland]], where the controversial &quot;rejuvenation therapy&quot; was practised. He later expressed regret for endorsing Glycel.{{Verify source|date=June 2007}}

Barnard divided the remainder of his years between [[Austria]], where he established the [[Christiaan Barnard Foundation]], dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world, and his game-farm in [[Beaufort West]], South Africa.

== Death ==
Christiaan Barnard died in September 2001, while on holiday in [[Paphos]], Cyprus. Early reports claimed that he had died of a heart attack, although an [[autopsy]] showed his death was caused by a severe asthma attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Autopsy confirms asthma killed Barnard | date= 5 September 2001 | url =http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main_old.php?id=4655&amp;archive=1 | work =[[Cyprus Mail]] | accessdate =15 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927202905/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main_old.php?id=4655&amp;archive=1 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Christiaan Barnard wrote two autobiographies. His first book, ''One Life'', was published in 1969 and subsequently sold copies worldwide. Some of the proceeds were used to set up the Chris Barnard Fund for research into heart disease and heart transplants in Cape Town. His second autobiography, ''The Second Life'', was published in 1993, eight years before his death.

Apart from his autobiographies, Dr Barnard also wrote several other books including:
*''The Donor''
*''Your Healthy Heart''
*''In The Night Season''
*''The Best Medicine''
*''Arthritis Handbook: How to Live With Arthritis''
*''Good Life Good Death: A Doctor's Case for Euthanasia and Suicide''
*''South Africa: Sharp Dissection''
*''50 Ways to a Healthy Heart''
*''Body Machine''

{{Close Relationships}}

'''Concubinage''' is an [[interpersonal relationship]] in which a person engages in an ongoing relationship (usually matrimonially and sexually oriented) with another person to whom they are not or cannot be married. The inability to marry may be due to differences in social rank (including [[slave]] status), or because the man is already married. Historically, the relationship involved a man in a higher social status, who usually has a legally sanctioned [[wife]] and maintains a second household with the lesser &quot;wife&quot;. The woman in such a relationship is referred to as a '''concubine'''.

[[Image:Hua-Qing-Chi-Yang-Gui-Fei.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Yang Guifei]] (719-756), the favoured concubine of Emperor [[Tang Xuanzong]] of [[China]].]]

Historically, concubinage was frequently voluntary (by the woman and/or her family's arrangement), as it provided a measure of economic security for the woman involved.

Under [[Roman law]], [[Roman culture]] under the empire came to tolerate concubinage as long as the relationship was durable and exclusive; for Roman jurists, concubinage was an honorable ''[[de facto]]'' situation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, &quot;The Household and its Freed Slaves&quot;, in Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby, eds, ''A History of Private Life; From Pagan Rome to Byzantium'' 1987:76).&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the concubine's legal status or the legal definition of her status, in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] for example, concubinage was akin, although inferior, to marriage. The children of a concubine were recognized as legal [[offspring]] of the father. However, their inheritance rights may have been inferior to younger children of a marriage, or they may have received a smaller inheritance. Men frequently used concubines to bear heirs when they were not able to produce sons with their wives.

==Ancient Greece==
In [[Ancient Greece]], the practice of keeping a slave concubine (Greek ''pallakis'') was little recorded but appears throughout Athenian history. Law prescribed that a man could kill another man caught with his concubine for the production of free children, which suggests that a concubine's children were not granted citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes:  The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens |page = 98 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While references to the sexual exploitation of maidservants appear in literature, it was considered disgraceful for a man to keep such women under the same roof as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes:  The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens | pages = 98–99 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some interpretations of ''[[hetaera]]'' have held they were concubines when one had a permanent relationship with a single man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes:  The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens | page = 101 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Roman ''concubinae'' and ''concubini''==
{{Details|Marriage in ancient Rome#Concubinage}}
Concubinage was an institution practiced in [[ancient Rome]] that allowed a man to enter into an informal but recognized relationship with a woman (''concubina'', plural ''concubinae'') not his wife, most often a woman whose lower [[Social class in ancient Rome|social status]] was an obstacle to marriage. Concubinage was &quot;tolerated to the degree that it did not threaten the religious and legal integrity of the family&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Love in Ancient Rome (University of Oklahoma Press) 1986:111.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not considered derogatory to be called a ''concubina'', as the title was often inscribed on tombstones.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Kiefer, Sexual Life in Ancient Rome (Kegan Paul International) 2000:50.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''concubinus'' was a young male [[slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] chosen by his master as a sexual partner. Romans did not mark same-sex relations as &quot;homosexual&quot; if an adult male used a slave or prostitute, characteristically a youth, as his passive partner (see [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome]]). These relations, however, were expected to play a secondary role in marriage, within which institution an adult male demonstrated his masculine authority as head of the household ''([[paterfamilias]])''. In one of his [[epithalamium|wedding poems]], [[Catullus]] (''[[floruit|fl.]]'' mid-1st century BC) assumes that the young bridegroom has a ''concubinus'' who considers himself elevated above the other slaves, but who will be set aside as his master turns his attention to marriage and family life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catullus]], ''Carmen'' 61; Amy Richlin, &quot;Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men,&quot; ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), pp. 534–535.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bible==

Among the [[Israelites]], men commonly acknowledged their concubines, and such women enjoyed the same rights in the house as legitimate wives.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=PILEGESH (Hebrew, ; comp. Greek, παλλακίς).|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=313&amp;letter=P&amp;search=Pilegesh|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=13 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2002-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal difference in the [[Bible]] between a wife and a concubine is that wives had [[dowry|dowries]], while concubines did not.

The concubine may not have commanded the same respect and inviolability as the wife. In the [[Levitical]] rules on sexual relations, the Hebrew word that is commonly translated as &quot;wife&quot; is distinct from the Hebrew word that means &quot;concubine&quot;. (However, on at least one other occasion the term is used to refer to a woman who is not a wife - specifically, the handmaiden of Jacob's wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|30:4|}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In the Levitical code, sexual intercourse between a man and a wife of a different man was forbidden and punishable by death for both persons involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible notes several incidents of intercourse between a man and another man's concubine, and none of them resulted in capital punishment for either party,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|16:22|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|19:2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the man to whom the concubine belonged was dishonored by such a relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt; For instance, [[David]] is portrayed as having been dishonored when his concubines had a sexual relationship with his son [[Absalom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|16:21-25|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, legitimate wives often gave their maids to their husbands to atone, at least in part, if they were barren, as in the cases of [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and [[Rachel]] and [[Bilhah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt; The children of the concubine had equal rights with those of the legitimate wife;&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt; for example, King [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] was the son of [[Gideon]] and his concubine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|8:31|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt; biblical figures such as Gideon, and [[Solomon]] had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the [[Books of Kings]] say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Judaism==
In Judaism, concubines are referred to by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''pilegesh''. The term is a non-Hebrew, non-Semitic loanword derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word, ''pallakis'', Greek ''παλλακίς'',&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; meaning &quot;a mistress staying in house&quot;.

According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]],&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt; the difference between a concubine and a full wife was that the latter received a ''[[ketubah|marriage contract]]'' (Hebrew:''ketubah'') and her marriage (''[[nissuin|nissu'in]]'') was preceded by a formal betrothal (''[[erusin]]''). Neither was the case for a concubine. One opinion in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] argues that the concubine should also receive a ''marriage contract'', but without a clause specifying a divorce settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt;

Certain Jewish thinkers, such as [[Maimonides]], believed that concubines were strictly reserved for kings, and thus that a commoner may not have a concubine. Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of [[Human sexuality|sexual relations]] outside of a marriage. Even before Maimonides' assertions, [[Sunni Muslims]] officially prohibited ''[[mutah]]'' (i.e., temporary marriage) relationships. Some commentators {{Who|date=November 2009}} have suggested that Maimonides changed his view in response to the Sunni prohibition, just as [[Gershom ben Judah]] banned [[polygamy]] after Christians prohibited the practice.

Maimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, [[Leviticus Rabbah]] severely condemns the custom.&lt;ref&gt;''Leviticus Rabbah'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish thinkers, such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus]], and [[Jacob Emden]], strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.

In the Hebrew of the contemporary [[State of Israel]], the word ''pilegesh'' is often used as the equivalent of the English word ''[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]''&amp;mdash;i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations&amp;mdash;regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise ''pilegesh'' as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by [[Halakha|Jewish law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kosher sex without marriage|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=16328|accessdate=13 June 2012|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=16 March 2006|author=MATTHEW WAGNER}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Dickter, &quot;ISO: Kosher Concubine&quot;, ''New York Jewish Week'', December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html SUZANNE GLASS, &quot;THE CONCUBINE CONNECTION&quot;], ''The Independent'', London 20 October 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient China==
[[File:A Chinese Emperor With his Concubines Inspecting his Fantasy Fishing Fleet.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A European painting of an [[Emperor of China]] inspecting his fantasy fishing fleet with his concubines]]

In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], successful men often supported several concubines. For example, it has been documented that [[Chinese Emperors]] accommodated thousands of concubines.&lt;ref name=CAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Concubines of Ancient China|url=http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/beijing-history/concubines-of-ancient-china|work=Beijing Made Easy|publisher=Beijing Made Easy|accessdate=13 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A concubine's treatment and situation were highly variable and were influenced by the social status of the male to whom she was engaged, as well as the attitude of the wife. The position of the concubine was generally inferior to that of the wife. Although a concubine could produce heirs, her children would be inferior in social status to &quot;legitimate&quot; children. Allegedly, concubines were occasionally buried alive with their masters to &quot;keep them company in the afterlife.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAC&quot;/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on ancient Chinese concubines, history and literature offer examples of concubines who achieved great power and influence. For example, in one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] of China, ''[[The Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' (believed to be a [[semi-autobiographical]] account of author [[Cao Xueqin]]'s own family life), three generations of the Jia family are supported by one favorite concubine of the Emperor.

Imperial concubines, kept by Emperors in the [[Forbidden City]], were traditionally guarded by [[eunuchs]] to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAC&quot;/&gt; Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as [[Dowager Empress Cixi]], was arguably one of the most successful concubines in China’s history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to the [[Xianfeng Emperor]] and gave birth to his only surviving son, who would become the [[Tongzhi Emperor]]. She would eventually become the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of the Manchu Qing Dynasty in China for 47 years after her son's death.&lt;ref name=EmpressChina&gt;{{cite book|author= Sterling Seagrave, Peggy Seagrave|title=Dragon lady: the life and legend of the last empress of China|year=1993|publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Thailand==
In Thailand, men were permitted{{when|date=March 2013}} to have multiple wives, whom they could sell, as well as their children. The principal wife could only be divorced.  If her husband died, she inherited the property rights to the secondary wives.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Jacq-Hergoualch, ''Le Siam'', ''Guide Belles Lettres des Civilisations,'' [[Les Belles Lettres]] 2004, ISBN 2-251-41023-6, pp. 210-211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
[[File:Jules Laurens 14.jpg|thumb|''Women of the Harem'' by [[Jules Laurens]], circa 1847|alt=Painting of seated women, with man standing]]
Islamic primary sources the [[Quran]] and the [[Sunnah]] declare that concubinage is permitted (''[[halal]]''). Chapter four (Surat-un-Nisa), verse three of the Quran &lt;ref&gt;Al-Quran Chapter 4, Verse 3&lt;/ref&gt; states that a man may be married to a maximum of four women if he can treat them with justice or depend on his slave woman. Islamic rights for concubines (slave women) ensure fair treatment within the household, and promise living expenses for concubines and their children. This same verse of the Quran (Chapter 4, verse 3) is the most authentic Islamic reference certifying that a Muslim man who could ensure equitable financial support for multiple spouses is further allowed to have concubines in addition to the prescribed four wives provided he assures justice. Authentic traditions in Sahih Bukhari, Shahi Muslim and Hayatul Qaloob confirm the same Islamic directives under explanation of Hadith.&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari (2012), Vol. 1, E - Book 8, Hadith # 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslim (2012), Hadith # 3371&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Majlisi, M. B. 1966 pp. 996&quot;&gt;Majlisi, M. B. (1966). Hayat-ul-Qaloob, Volume 2, Translated by Molvi Syed Basharat Hussain Sahib Kamil, Imamia Kutub Khana, Lahore, Pakistan, pp. 996–1000&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam considered every human free from birth (Deen-al-Fitrah).&lt;ref&gt;Al-Quran, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; It further rendered concubinage acceptable as a social need only under certain guidelines. Children of concubines were declared legitimate as children born in wedlock, like sons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Ibrahim was born from his slave woman Maria Qibtia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Majlisi, M. B. 1966 pp. 996&quot;/&gt; All children from slave women must receive living and education expenses until they become independent. In ancient times, Islam imposed very strict checks on how a woman became a concubine in order to prevent misuse.

In ancient times, two sources for concubines were permitted under an Islamic regime. Primarily, non-Muslim women taken as prisoners of war were made concubines as happened after the [[Battle of Bani Qariza]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Majlisi, M. B. 1966&quot;&gt;Majlisi, M. B. (1966). Hayat-ul-Qaloob, Volume 2, Translated by Molvi Syed Basharat Hussain Sahib Kamil, Imamia Kutub Khana, Lahore, Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternately, in ancient (Pagan/Pre-Islamic) times, sale and purchase of human slaves was a socially legal exercise. However, Islam encouraged their [[manumission]] in general. On embracing Islam, it was encouraged to manumit slave women or bring them into formal marriage (Nikah).

[[File:Cormon Fernand Le harem Oil On Canvas.jpg|thumb|left|''Scene from the Harem'' by [[Fernand Cormon]] (1845–1924)]]

Muhammad set an example of treating his slave women equivalent to his wives so that Arabs and other cultures could be reformed. The [[Sunnah]] reports that Muhammad had two or three concubines during his life.  Rehana was a prisoner of war whom Muhammad kept as a concubine after the battle against the tribe of Bani Qariza (Ghazwa Bani Qariza).&lt;ref name=&quot;Majlisi, M. B. 1966&quot;/&gt;  Maria Qibtia is reported to be another concubine that was gifted to Muhammad  by King Maqooqas in response to the letter inviting him towards Islam. King Maqooqas, in appreciation for the invitation, gifted two concubines (Maria Qibtia and her sister, Sirin) and two horses. Maria  gave birth to Muhammad's youngest son, Ibrahim. Muhammad promoted his concubines Maria Qibtia and Rehana, awarding them the same household rights, privileges and status as he did for his wives, effectively granting them the equivalent of the highest rank in Arab society that a woman could have.  Awarding to concubines (slave women) status equivalent to wives and fatherhood to their children was revolutionary for considering slaves equivalent to elites. This measure by Muhammad was necessary to curb the tradition in Arab society of misusing servants as concubines and later refuting their rights and those of their children.

According to the rules of Islamic Fiqas, what is ''halal'' (permitted) by Muhammad cannot be altered by any authority or individual. Therefore, although the ''concept'' of concubinage is ''halal'', concubines are no longer available in this modern era nor allowed to be sold or purchased in accordance with the latest human rights standards. However, as change of existing Islamic law is impossible, if there happens to be a concubine in this modern era anyhow, she must be given all the due rights which Islam had preserved in the past. It is further clarified that all domestic and organizational female employees are not concubines in this era and hence sex is forbidden with them unless Nikkah (formal marriage) or mut'ah (temporary marriage - which only Shiite Islam permits) is committed through the proper channels. The Sunni scholars also do not allow ''[[mut'ah]]'', or temporary marriage. According to Shiite scholars it is the Islamic mode of engagement before Nikkah (formal long term marriage) to assess each other's suitability as a spouse. Engagement before marriage is a need for which Shiite Islamic interpretation provides Mut'ah. Although sometimes the two are confused, Mut'ah is not concubinage.

==In the United States==
[[File:Free Woman of Color with daughter NOLA Collage .jpg|thumb|180px|[[Free people of color|Free woman of color]] with [[quadroon]] daughter; late 18th century collage painting, [[New Orleans]].]]
When [[slavery]] became institutionalized in the North American colonies, white men, whether or not they were married, sometimes took enslaved women as concubines. Marriage between the races was prohibited by law in the colonies and the later United States. Many colonies and states also had laws against [[miscegenation]], or any interracial relations. From 1662 the Colony of Virginia, followed by others, incorporated into law the principle that children took their mother's status, i.e., the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''. All children born to enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of their father's status or ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolchin17&quot;&gt;[[Peter Kolchin]], ''American Slavery, 1619-1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; This led to generations of [[mixed-race]] slaves, some of whom were otherwise considered legally white (one-eighth or less African, equivalent to a great-grandparent) before the [[American Civil War]].

In some cases, men had long-term relationships with enslaved women, giving them and their mixed-race children freedom and providing their children with apprenticeships, education and transfer of capital. In other cases, the men did nothing for the women except in a minor way. Such arrangements were more prevalent in [[Southern United States|the South]] during the antebellum years.

Historians widely believe that the widower [[Thomas Jefferson]], both before and during his presidency of the United States in the early 19th century, had an intimate relationship of 38 years with his [[mixed-race]] slave [[Sally Hemings]] and fathered all of her six children of record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hemings&quot;&gt;[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html &quot;Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account&quot;], Monticello Website, Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Retrieved 22 June 2011. Quote: &quot;Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife’s death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He freed all four of her surviving children as they came of age. The Hemingses were the only slave family to go free from Monticello. The children were seven-eighths European in ancestry and legally white. Three entered the white community as adults. A [[Jefferson-Hemings controversy|1998 DNA study]] showed a match between the Jefferson male line and a male descendant of Sally Hemings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hemings&quot;/&gt;

In [[Louisiana]] and former French territories, a formalized system of concubinage called ''[[plaçage]]'' developed. European men took enslaved or [[free people of color|free women of color]] as mistresses after making arrangements to give them a dowry, house or other transfer of property, and sometimes, if they were enslaved, offering freedom and education for their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;everyculture.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Creoles.html  Helen Bush Caver and Mary T. Williams, &quot;Creoles&quot;], ''Multicultural America'', Countries and Their Cultures Website. Retrieved 3 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  A third class of [[free people of color]] developed, especially in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;everyculture.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery, 1619-1865'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; Many became educated, artisans and property owners. French-speaking and practicing [[Catholics]], who combined French and African-American culture, created an elite between the whites of European descent and the masses of slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;everyculture.com&quot;/&gt; Today descendants of the free people of color are generally called [[Louisiana Creole people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;everyculture.com&quot;/&gt;

'''Central Plaza''' is a 78-[[storey]], {{convert|374|m|abbr=on}} [[skyscraper]] completed in August 1995 at 18 [[Harbour Road]], in [[Wan Chai]] on [[Hong Kong Island]] in [[Hong Kong]]. It is the third tallest tower in the city after [[International Finance Centre|2 IFC]] in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and the [[International Commerce Centre|ICC]] in [[West Kowloon]]. It was the tallest building in Asia from 1992 to 1996, until the [[Shun Hing Square]] in neighbouring [[Shenzhen]] was built. Central Plaza surpassed the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] as the tallest building in Hong Kong until the completion of [[International Finance Centre#Two International Finance Centre|2IFC]].

Central Plaza was also the tallest [[reinforced concrete]] building in the world, until it was surpassed by [[CITIC Plaza]], [[Guangzhou]]. The building uses a triangular [[floor plan]]. On the top of the tower is a four-bar neon clock that indicates the time by displaying different colours in 15 minute intervals, blinking at the change of the quarter.

An [[anemometer]] is installed on the tip of the building's mast; the anemometer sits at {{convert|378|m}} above sea level. The mast has a height of {{convert|102|m|abbr=on}}. It also houses the world's highest [[Church (building)|church]] inside a skyscraper, [http://www.skycitychurch.com Sky City Church].

==Design==
[[Image:HK Central Plaza 60407 1st.jpg|left|thumb|Main Lobby]]
Central Plaza is made up of two principal components: a free standing {{convert|368|m}} high office tower and a {{convert|30.5|m|abbr=on}} high podium block attached to it. The tower is made up of three sections: a {{convert|30.5|m|abbr=on}} high tower base forming the main entrance and public circulation spaces; a {{convert|235.4|m|abbr=on}} tall tower body containing 57 office floors, a [[sky lobby]] and five mechanical plant floors; and the tower top consist of six mechanical plant floors and a {{convert|102|m|abbr=on}} tall tower mast.

The ground level public area along with the public sitting out area form an {{convert|8400|m²|abbr=on}} landscaped garden with fountain, trees and artificial stone paving. No commercial element is included in the podium. The first level is a public thoroughfare for three pedestrian bridges linking the Mass Transit Railway, the Convention and Exhibition Centre and the China Resource Building. By turning these space to public use, the building got 20% plot ratio more as bonus. The shape of the tower is not truly triangular but with its three corners cut off to provide better internal office spaces.

==Design constraints==
[[Image:Central Plaza Sky Lobby.JPG|left|thumb|The Sky Lobby]]

===Triangular shaped floor plan===
The building was designed to be in triangular shape because it could provide 20% more of the office area to enjoy the harbour view as compared with the square or rectangular shaped buildings. From an architectural point of view, this arrangement could provide better floor area utilisation, offering an internal column-free office area with a clear depth of {{convert|9|to|13.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an overall usable floor area efficiency of 81%.
Nonetheless, the triangular building plan causes the air handling unit (AHU) room in the internal core also to assume a triangular configuration with only limited space. This makes the adoption of a standard AHU not feasible. Furthermore, all air-conditioning ducting, electrical trunking and piping gathered inside the core area had to be squeezed into a very narrow and congested corridor ceiling void.

===Super high-rise building===
As the building is situated opposite to the HKCEC, the only way to get more sea view for the building and not be obstructed by the neighbouring high-rise buildings is to build it tall enough. However, a tall building brings a lot of difficulties to structural and building services design, for example, excessive system static pressure for water systems, high line voltage drop and long distance of vertical transportation. All these problems can increase the capital cost of the building systems and impair the safety operation of the building.

===Maximum clear ceiling height===
As a general practice, for achieving a clear height of {{convert|2.6|to|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a floor-to-floor height of {{convert|3.9|to|4.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} would be required. However, because of high windload in Hong Kong for such a super high-rise building, every increase in building height by a metre would increase the structural cost by more than HK$1 million (HK$304,800 per ft). Therefore a comprehensive study was conducted and finally a floor height of {{convert|3.6|m|abbr=on}} was adopted. With this issue alone, an estimated construction cost saving for a total of 58 office floors, would be around HK$30 million. Yet at the same time, a maximum ceiling height of {{convert|2.6|m|abbr=on}} in office area could still be achieved with careful coordination and dedicated integration.

===Structural constraints===
[[Image:Sky City Church Lounge.jpg|thumb|Sky City Church lounge area in the Apex]]
*The site is a newly reclaimed area with a maximum water table rises to about {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} below ground level. In the original brief, a 6 storey basement is required, therefore a diaphragm wall design came out.
*The keyword to this project is: time. With a briefing in a limited detail, the structural engineer needed to start work The diaphragm wall design allowed for the basement to be constructed by the top-down method. It allows the superstructure to be constructed at the same time as the basement, thereby removing time consuming basement construction period from the critical path.
*Wind loading is another major design criterion in Hong Kong as it is situated in an area influenced by typhoons. Not only must the structure be able to resist the loads generally and the cladding system and its fixings resist higher local loads, but the building must also perform dynamically in an acceptable manner such that predicted movements lie within acceptable standards of occupant comfort criteria. To ensure that all aspects of the building's performance in strong winds will be acceptable, a detailed wind tunnel study was carried out by Professor [[Alan Davenport]] at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory at the [[University of Western Ontario]].

===Steel structure vs reinforced concrete===
Steel structure is more commonly adopted in high-rise building. In the original scheme, an externally cross-braced framed tube was applied with primary/secondary beams carrying metal decking with reinforced concrete slab. The core was also of steelwork, designed to carry vertical load only. Later after a financial review by the developer, they decided to reduce the height of the superstructure by increasing the size of the floor plate so as to reduce the complex architectural requirements of the tower base which means a highstrength concrete solution became possible.

In the final scheme, columns at {{convert|4.6|m|abbr=on}} centres and {{convert|1.1|m|abbr=on}} deep floor edge beams were used to replace the large steel corner columns. As climbing form and table form construction method and efficient construction management are used in this project which make this reinforced concrete structure take no longer construction time than the steel structure. And the most attractive point is that the reinforced concrete scheme can save HK$230 million compared to that of steel structure. Hence the reinforced concrete structure was adopted and Central Plaza is now one of the tallest reinforced concrete buildings in the world.

In the reinforced concrete structure scheme, the core has a similar arrangement to the steel scheme and the wind shear is taken out from the core at the lowest basement level and transferred to the perimeter diaphragm walls. In order to reduce large shear reversals in the core walls in the basement, and at the top of the tower base level, the ground floor, basement levels 1 and 2 and the 5th and 6th floors, the floor slabs and beams are separated horizontally from the core walls.

Another advantage of using reinforced concrete structure is that it is more flexible to cope with changes in structural layout, sizes and height according to the site conditions by using table form system.

'''Michelangelo Merisi or Amerighi da Caravaggio''' ({{IPA-it|karaˈvaddʒo}}; 29 September 1571? – 18 July 1610?) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[artist]] active in [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Malta]], and [[Sicily]] between 1592 (1595?) and 1610. His paintings, which combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, had a formative influence on the [[Baroque]] [[Baroque painting|school of painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.it/books?id=_dROAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22caravaggio+per+molte+scuole%22&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RoHoUZbdMaTK4ATs_4GQCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caravaggio%20per%20molte%20scuole%22&amp;f=false |title=Descrizzione completa di tutto ciò che ritrovasi nella galleria di pittura e scultura di sua altezza Giuseppe Venceslao del S.R.I.

Caravaggio trained as a painter in [[Milan]] under [[Simone Peterzano]] who had himself trained under [[Titian]]. In his twenties Caravaggio moved to Rome where, during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, many huge new churches and [[palazzi]] were being built and paintings were needed to fill them. During the [[Counter-Reformation]], the Roman Catholic Church searched for [[Sacred art|religious art]] with which to counter the threat of [[Protestantism]], and for this task the artificial conventions of [[Mannerism]], which had ruled art for almost a century, no longer seemed adequate.

Caravaggio's novelty was a radical [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]] that combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, use of [[chiaroscuro]]. This came to be known as [[Tenebrism]], the shift from light to dark with little intermediate value. He burst upon the Rome art scene in 1600 with the success of his first public commissions, the ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]'' and ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|Calling of Saint Matthew]]''. Thereafter he never lacked commissions or patrons, yet he handled his success poorly. He was jailed on several occasions, vandalized his own apartment, and ultimately had a death warrant issued for him by the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watkins |first=Ally |url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/37059/caravaggios-rap-sheet-reveals-him-to-have-been-a-lawless-sword-obsessed-wildman-and-a-terrible-renter/ |title=Caravaggio's Rap Sheet Reveals Him to Have Been a Lawless Sword-Obsessed Wildman, and a Terrible Renter |publisher=Artinfo |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early published notice on him, dating from 1604 and describing his lifestyle three years previously, tells how &quot;after a fortnight's work he will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him, from one ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument, so that it is most awkward to get along with him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Floris Claes van Dijk, a contemporary of Caravaggio in Rome in 1601, quoted in John Gash, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p.13. The quotation originates in [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''Het Schilder-Boek'' of 1604, translated in full in Howard Hibbard, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;. The first reference to Caravaggio in a contemporary document from Rome is the listing of his name, with that of Prospero Orsi as his partner, as an 'assistente' in a procession in October 1594 in honour of St. Luke (see H. Waga &quot;Vita nota e ignota dei virtuosi al Pantheon&quot; Rome 1992, Appendix I, pp.219 and 220ff). The earliest informative account of his life in the city  is a court transcript dated 11 July 1597, when Caravaggio and Prospero Orsi were witnesses to a crime near San Luigi de' Francesi. (See &quot;The earliest account of Caravaggio in Rome&quot; Sandro Corradini and Maurizio Marini, [[The Burlington Magazine]], pp.25–28).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1606 he killed a young man in a brawl and fled from Rome with a price on his head. He was involved in a brawl in [[Malta]] in 1608, and another in [[Naples]] in 1609, possibly a deliberate attempt on his life by unidentified enemies. This encounter left him severely injured. A year later, at the age of 38, he died under mysterious circumstances in [[Porto Ercole]], reportedly from a fever while on his way to [[Rome]] to receive a pardon.

Famous while he lived, Caravaggio was forgotten almost immediately after his death, and it was only in the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. Despite this, his influence on the new Baroque style that eventually emerged from the ruins of [[Mannerism]] was profound. It can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of [[Rubens]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Bernini]], and [[Rembrandt]], and artists in the following generation heavily under his influence were called the &quot;Caravaggisti&quot; or &quot;Caravagesques&quot;, as well as [[Tenebrism|Tenebrists]] or &quot;Tenebrosi&quot; (&quot;shadowists&quot;). Art historian Andre Berne-Joffroy said of him: &quot;What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gilles Lambert, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life (1571–1592)===
[[File:Boy with a Basket of Fruit-Caravaggio (1593).jpg|left|thumb|''[[Boy with a Basket of Fruit (Caravaggio)|Boy with a Basket of Fruit]]'', 1593–1594. Oil on canvas, {{convert|67|x|53|cm|0|lk=out|abbr=on}}. [[Galleria Borghese]], [[Rome]].]]

Caravaggio (Michelangelo Merisi or Amerighi) was born in [[Milan]] where his father, Fermo (Fermo Merixio), was a household administrator and architect-decorator to the Marchese of [[Caravaggio, Lombardy|Caravaggio]], a town not far from the city of [[Bergamo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confirmed by the finding of the baptism certificate from the Milanese parish of Santo Stefano in Brolo|url=http://www.italica.rai.it/index.php?categoria=bio&amp;scheda=caravaggio_prima_parte|publisher=Italica.rai.it|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother, Lucia Aratori (Lutia de Oratoribus), came from a propertied family of the same district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VnOgwMBmdakC&amp;pg=PA447&amp;lpg=PA447&amp;dq=Lucia+Aratori&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J3hLQnDjAM&amp;sig=1zaNbkbqFuWSQuRLzRDOIFNygeM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f7-bUdL9HO-WyAGR7oHoBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Lucia%20Aratori&amp;f=false | title =That Terrible Shadowing: The Quest Across Time for Caravaggio's Killer | author =David Stedman | publisher =books.google.com | pages =183, 447 | isbn =978-1848761315 | year =2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1576 the family moved to Caravaggio (Caravaggius) to escape a plague which ravaged Milan, and Caravaggio's father died there in 1577.&lt;ref name =&quot;ParisArtStudies&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parisartstudies.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=129 | title =Paris Art Studies Caravaggio | publisher =parisartstudies.com | year =2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that the artist grew up in Caravaggio, but his family kept up connections with the [[Sforza]]s and with the powerful [[Colonna]] family, who were allied by marriage with the Sforzas and destined to play a major role later in Caravaggio's life.

Caravaggio's mother died in 1584, the same year he began his four-year apprenticeship to the Milanese painter [[Simone Peterzano]], described in the contract of apprenticeship as a pupil of [[Titian]]. Caravaggio appears to have stayed in the Milan-Caravaggio area after his apprenticeship ended, but it is possible that he visited [[Venice]] and saw the works of [[Giorgione]], whom [[Federico Zuccari]] later accused him of imitating, and [[Titian]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; He would also have become familiar with the art treasures of Milan, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]'', and with the regional Lombard art, a style which valued simplicity and attention to [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalistic]] detail and was closer to the naturalism of Germany than to the stylised formality and grandeur of Roman [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Giorgi, &quot;Caravaggio: Master of light and dark – his life in paintings&quot;, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome (1592/95–1600)===
[[File:Caravaggio - I Musici.jpg|thumb|''[[The Musicians (Caravaggio)|The Musicians]]'', 1595–1596, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York]].]]
Caravaggio left Milan for Rome in 1592, in flight after &quot;certain quarrels&quot; and the wounding of a police officer. He arrived in Rome &quot;naked and extremely needy ... without fixed address and without provision ... short of money.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted without attribution in Robb, p.35, apparently based on the three primary sources, Mancini, Baglione and Bellori, all of whom depict Caravaggio's early Roman years as a period of extreme poverty (see references below).&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later he was performing hack-work for the highly successful [[Giuseppe Cesari]], [[Pope Clement VIII]]'s favourite artist, &quot;painting flowers and fruit&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Pietro Bellori, ''Le Vite de' pittori, scultori, et architetti moderni'', 1672: &quot;Michele was forced by necessity to enter the services of Cavalier Giuseppe d'Arpino, by whom he was employed to paint flowers and fruits so realistically that they began to attain the higher beauty that we love so much today.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in his factory-like workshop. Known works from this period include a small ''[[Boy Peeling Fruit (Caravaggio)|Boy Peeling a Fruit]]'' (his earliest known painting), a ''[[Boy with a Basket of Fruit (Caravaggio)|Boy with a Basket of Fruit]]'', and the ''[[Young Sick Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Young Sick Bacchus]]'', supposedly a self-portrait done during convalescence from a serious illness that ended his employment with Cesari. All three demonstrate the physical particularity for which Caravaggio was to become renowned: the fruit-basket-boy's produce has been analysed by a professor of horticulture, who was able to identify individual cultivars right down to &quot;... a large fig leaf with a prominent fungal scorch lesion resembling [[anthracnose]] (''Glomerella cingulata'').&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/caravaggio/caravaggio_l.html |title=Caravaggio |publisher=Hort.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Canestra di frutta (Caravaggio).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Basket of Fruit (Caravaggio)|Basket of Fruit]],'' c. 1595–1596, oil on canvas, [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]], [[Milan]].]]

Caravaggio left Cesari, determined to make his own way. At this point he forged some extremely important friendships, with the painter [[Prospero Orsi]], the architect [[Onorio Longhi]], and the sixteen-year-old [[Sicily|Sicilian]] artist [[Mario Minniti]]. Orsi, established in the profession, introduced him to influential collectors; Longhi, more balefully, introduced him to the world of Roman street-brawls; and Minniti served as a model and, years later, would be instrumental in helping Caravaggio to important commissions in Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Puglisi, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p.79. Longhi was with Caravaggio on the night of the fatal brawl with Tomassoni; Robb, &quot;M&quot;, p.341, believes that Minniti was as well.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|The Fortune Teller]]'', his first composition with more than one figure, shows Mario being cheated by a gypsy girl. The theme was quite new for Rome, and proved immensely influential over the next century and beyond. This, however, was in the future: at the time, Caravaggio sold it for practically nothing. ''[[Cardsharps|The Cardsharps]]'' — showing another naïve youth of privilege falling the victim of card cheats — is even more psychologically complex, and perhaps Caravaggio's first true masterpiece. Like the ''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|Fortune Teller]]'', it was immensely popular, and over 50 copies survive. More importantly, it attracted the patronage of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francesco Maria Del Monte]], one of the leading connoisseurs in Rome. For Del Monte and his wealthy art-loving circle, Caravaggio executed a number of intimate chamber-pieces — ''[[The Musicians (Caravaggio)|The Musicians]]'', ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'', a tipsy ''[[Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Bacchus]]'', an allegorical but realistic ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard (Caravaggio)|Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]'' — featuring Minniti and other adolescent models.

[[File:Caravaggio Judith Beheading Holofernes.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)|Judith Beheading Holofernes]]'' 1598–1599. [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], Rome.]]

The realism returned with Caravaggio's first paintings on religious themes, and the emergence of remarkable spirituality. The first of these was the ''[[Penitent Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Penitent Magdalene]]'', showing [[Mary Magdalene]] at the moment when she has turned from her life as a courtesan and sits weeping on the floor, her jewels scattered around her. &quot;It seemed not a religious painting at all ... a girl sitting on a low wooden stool drying her hair ... Where was the repentance ... suffering ... promise of salvation?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robb, p.79. Robb is drawing on Bellori, who praises Caravaggio's &quot;true&quot; colours but finds the naturalism offensive: &quot;He (Caravaggio) was satisfied with [the] invention of nature without further exercising his brain.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

It was understated, in the Lombard manner, not histrionic in the Roman manner of the time. It was followed by others in the same style: ''[[Saint Catherine (Caravaggio)|Saint Catherine]]''; ''[[Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Martha and Mary Magdalene]]''; ''[[Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)|Judith Beheading Holofernes]]''; a ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac (Caravaggio)|Sacrifice of Isaac]]''; a ''[[Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy (Caravaggio)|Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy]]''; and a ''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Caravaggio)|Rest on the Flight into Egypt]]''. The works, while viewed by a comparatively limited circle, increased Caravaggio's fame with both connoisseurs and his fellow artists. But a true reputation would depend on public commissions, and for these it was necessary to look to the Church.

Already evident was the intense realism or naturalism for which Caravaggio is now famous. He preferred to paint his subjects as the eye sees them, with all their natural flaws and defects instead of as idealised creations. This allowed a full display of Caravaggio's virtuosic talents. This shift from accepted standard practice and the classical idealism of [[Michelangelo]] was very controversial at the time. Not only was his realism a noteworthy feature of his paintings during this period, he turned away from the lengthy preparations traditional in central Italy at the time. Instead, he preferred the Venetian practice of working in oils directly from the subject – half-length figures and still life. One of the characteristic paintings by Caravaggio at this time which gives a good demonstration of his virtuoso talent was his work ''[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio, London version)|Supper at Emmaus]]'' from c.1600–1601.

===&quot;Most famous painter in Rome&quot; (1600–1606)===
[[File:Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da - The Calling of Saint Matthew - 1599-1600 (hi res).jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of Saint Matthew]]'' (1599–1600). [[Contarelli Chapel]], [[San Luigi dei Francesi]], [[Rome]]. The beam of light, which enters the picture from the direction of a real window, expresses in the blink of an eye the conversion of St Matthew, the hinge on which his destiny will turn, with no flying angels, parting clouds or other artifacts.]]

In 1599, presumably through the influence of Del Monte, Caravaggio was contracted to decorate the [[Contarelli Chapel]] in the church of [[San Luigi dei Francesi]]. The two works making up the commission, the ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]'' and ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|Calling of Saint Matthew]]'', delivered in 1600, were an immediate sensation. Caravaggio's [[tenebrism]] (a heightened [[chiaroscuro]]) brought high drama to his subjects, while his acutely observed realism brought a new level of emotional intensity. Opinion among Caravaggio's artist peers was polarized. Some denounced him for various perceived failings, notably his insistence on painting from life, without drawings, but for the most part he was hailed as a great artistic visionary: &quot;The painters then in Rome were greatly taken by this novelty, and the young ones particularly gathered around him, praised him as the unique imitator of nature, and looked on his work as miracles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bellori. The passage continues: &quot;[The younger painters] outdid each other in copying him, undressing their models and raising their lights; and rather than setting out to learn from study and instruction, each readily found in the streets or squares of Rome both masters and models for copying nature.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio went on to secure a string of prestigious commissions for religious works featuring violent struggles, grotesque decapitations, torture and death, most notable and most technically masterful among them ''[[The Taking of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Taking of Christ]]'' of circa 1602 for the Mattei Family, recently rediscovered in Ireland after two centuries. For the most part each new painting increased his fame, but a few were rejected by the various bodies for whom they were intended, at least in their original forms, and had to be re-painted or find new buyers. The essence of the problem was that while Caravaggio's dramatic intensity was appreciated, his realism was seen by some as unacceptably vulgar.&lt;ref&gt;For an outline of the Counter-Reformation Church's policy on decorum in art, see Giorgi, p.80. For a more detailed discussion, see Gash, p.8ff; and for a discussion of the part played by notions of decorum in the rejection of &quot;St Matthew and the Angel&quot; and &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot;, see Puglisi, pp.179–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

His first version of ''[[Saint Matthew and the Angel (Caravaggio)|Saint Matthew and the Angel]]'', featured the saint as a bald peasant with dirty legs attended by a lightly clad over-familiar boy-angel, was rejected and a second version had to be painted as ''[[The Inspiration of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Inspiration of Saint Matthew]]''. Similarly, ''[[The Conversion of Saint Paul (Caravaggio)|The Conversion of Saint Paul]]'' was rejected, and while another version of the same subject, the ''[[Conversion on the Way to Damascus]]'', was accepted, it featured the saint's horse's haunches far more prominently than the saint himself, prompting this exchange between the artist and an exasperated official of [[Santa Maria del Popolo]]: &quot;Why have you put a horse in the middle, and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] on the ground?&quot; &quot;Because!&quot; &quot;Is the horse God?&quot; &quot;No, but he stands in God's light!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted without attribution in Lambert, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works included ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment]]'', the ''[[Madonna di Loreto (Caravaggio)|Madonna di Loreto]]'' (''Madonna of the Pilgrims''), the ''[[Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri) (Caravaggio)|Grooms' Madonna]]'', and the ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]''. The history of these last two paintings illustrates the reception given to some of Caravaggio's art, and the times in which he lived. The ''[[Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri) (Caravaggio)|Grooms' Madonna]]'', also known as ''Madonna dei palafrenieri'', painted for a small altar in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome, remained there for just two days, and was then taken off. A cardinal's secretary wrote: &quot;In this painting there are but vulgarity, sacrilege, impiousness and disgust...One would say it is a work made by a painter that can paint well, but of a dark spirit, and who has been for a lot of time far from God, from His adoration, and from any good thought...&quot;
The ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'', then, commissioned in 1601 by a wealthy jurist for his private chapel in the new Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala, was rejected by the Carmelites in 1606. Caravaggio's contemporary [[Giulio Mancini]] records that it was rejected because Caravaggio had used a well-known prostitute as his model for the Virgin.&lt;ref&gt;Mancini: &quot;Thus one can understand how badly some modern artists paint, such as those who, wishing to portray the Virgin Our Lady, depict some dirty prostitute from the Ortaccio, as Michelangelo da Caravaggio did in the Death of the Virgin in that painting for the Madonna della Scala, which for that very reason those good fathers rejected it, and perhaps that poor man suffered so much trouble in his lifetime.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giovanni Baglione]], another contemporary, tells us it was due to Mary's bare legs&lt;ref&gt;Baglione: &quot;For the [church of] Madonna della Scala in Trastevere he painted the death of the Madonna, but because he had portrayed the Madonna with little decorum, swollen and with bare legs, it was taken away, and the Duke of Mantua bought it and placed it in his most noble gallery.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; —a matter of decorum in either case. Caravaggio scholar John Gash suggests that the problem for the Carmelites may have been theological rather than aesthetic, in that Caravaggio's version fails to assert the doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary]], the idea that the Mother of God did not die in any ordinary sense but was assumed into Heaven. The replacement altarpiece commissioned (from one of Caravaggio's most able followers, [[Carlo Saraceni]]), showed the Virgin not dead, as Caravaggio had painted her, but seated and dying; and even this was rejected, and replaced with a work which showed the Virgin not dying, but ascending into Heaven with choirs of angels. In any case, the rejection did not mean that Caravaggio or his paintings were out of favour. The ''Death of the Virgin'' was no sooner taken out of the church than it was purchased by the Duke of Mantua, on the advice of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and later acquired by [[Charles I of England]] before entering the French royal collection in 1671.

One secular piece from these years is ''[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Victorious]]'', painted in 1602 for [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], a member of Del Monte's circle. The model was named in a memoir of the early 17th century as &quot;Cecco&quot;, the diminutive for Francesco. He is possibly Francesco Boneri, identified with an artist active in the period 1610–1625 and known as [[Cecco del Caravaggio]] ('Caravaggio's Cecco'),&lt;ref&gt;While Gianni Papi's identification of Cecco del Caravaggio as Francesco Boneri is widely accepted, the evidence connecting Boneri to Caravaggio's servant and model in the early 17th century is circumstantial. See Robb, pp193–196.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying a bow and arrows and trampling symbols of the warlike and peaceful arts and sciences underfoot. He is unclothed, and it is difficult to accept this grinning urchin as the Roman god [[Cupid]] – as difficult as it was to accept Caravaggio's other semi-clad adolescents as the various angels he painted in his canvases, wearing much the same stage-prop wings. The point, however, is the intense yet ambiguous reality of the work: it is simultaneously Cupid and Cecco, as Caravaggio's Virgins were simultaneously the Mother of Christ and the Roman courtesans who modeled for them.

===Exile and death (1606–1610)===
Caravaggio led a tumultuous life. He was notorious for brawling, even in a time and place when such behavior was commonplace, and the transcripts of his police records and trial proceedings fill several pages. On 29 May 1606, he killed, possibly unintentionally, a young man named Ranuccio Tomassoni from Terni (Umbria).&lt;ref&gt;The circumstances of the brawl and the death of Ranuccio Tomassoni remain mysterious. Several contemporary ''avvisi'' referred to a quarrel over a gambling debt and a tennis game, and this explanation has become established in the popular imagination. But recent scholarship has made it clear that more was involved. Good modern accounts are to be found in Peter Robb's &quot;M&quot; and Helen Langdon's &quot;Caravaggio: A Life&quot;. An interesting theory relating the death to Renaissance notions of honour and symbolic wounding has been advanced by art historian [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]]. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1396127/Red-blooded-Caravaggio-killed-love-rival-in-bungled-castration-attempt.html 'Red-blooded Caravaggio killed love rival in bungled castration attempt']&lt;/ref&gt; Previously his high-placed patrons had protected him from the consequences of his escapades, but this time they could do nothing. Caravaggio, outlawed, fled to [[Naples]]. There, outside the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities and protected by the Colonna family, the most famous painter in Rome became the most famous in Naples. His connections with the [[Colonna family|Colonnas]] led to a stream of important church commissions, including the ''[[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|Madonna of the Rosary]]'', and ''[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In 1606, following the death of Tomassoni, he fled first to the Colonna estates south of Rome, then on to Naples where Costanza Colonna Sforza, widow of Francesco Sforza, in whose husband's household Caravaggio's father had held a position, maintained a palace. Costanza's brother Ascanio was Cardinal-Protector of the Kingdom of Naples, another brother, Marzio, was an advisor to the Spanish Viceroy, and a sister was married into the important Neapolitan Carafa family—connections which might help explain the cornucopia of major commissions which fell into Caravaggio's lap in that city. Costanza's son Fabrizio Sforza Colonna, Knight of Malta and general of the Order's galleys, appears to have facilitated his arrival in the island in 1607 and his escape the next year, and he stayed in Costanza's Neapolitan palazzo on his return there in 1609. These connections are treated in most biographies and studies—see, for example, Catherine Puglisi, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p.258, for a brief outline. Helen Langdon, &quot;Caravaggio: A Life&quot;, ch.12 and 15, and Peter Robb, &quot;M&quot;, pp.398ff and 459ff, give a fuller account.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his success in Naples, after only a few months in the city Caravaggio left for [[Malta]], the headquarters of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]], presumably hoping that the patronage of [[Alof de Wignacourt]], Grand Master of the Knights, could help him secure a pardon for Tomassoni's death. De Wignacourt proved so impressed at having the famous artist as official painter to the Order that he inducted him as a knight, and the early biographer Bellori records that the artist was well pleased with his success.  Major works from his Malta period include a huge ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|Beheading of Saint John the Baptist]]'' (the only painting to which he put his signature) and a ''[[Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page (Caravaggio)|Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page]]'', as well as portraits of other leading knights. Yet by late August 1608 he was arrested and imprisoned.  The circumstances surrounding this abrupt change of fortune have long been a matter of speculation, but recent investigation has revealed it to have been the result of yet another brawl, during which the door of a house was battered down and a knight seriously wounded.&lt;ref&gt;The discovery of the evidence for this brawl was reported by Dr Keith Sciberras of the University of Malta, in &quot;Frater Michael Angelus in tumultu: the cause of Caravaggio's imprisonment in Malta&quot;, ''The Burlington Magazine'', CXLV, April 2002, pp.229–232, and &quot;Riflessioni su Malta al tempo del Caravaggio&quot;, ''Paragone Arte'', Anno LII N.629, July 2002, pp.3–20.  Sciberras' findings are summarised online at [http://caravaggio.com/preview/attach/data01/D000199.htm Caravaggio.com].&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned by the knights and managed to escape. By December he had been expelled from the Order &quot;as a foul and rotten member.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;This was the formal phrase used in all such cases. The senior knights of the Order convened on 1 December 1608 and, after verifying that the accused had failed to appear although summoned four times, voted unanimously to expel their ''putridum et foetidum'' ex-brother. Caravaggio was expelled, not for his crime, but for having left Malta without permission (i.e., escaping).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caravaggio - Sette opere di Misericordia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]]'', 1606–1607, [[Pio Monte della Misericordia]], [[Naples]].]]

Caravaggio made his way to [[Sicily]] where he met his old friend Mario Minniti, who was now married and living in [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. Together they set off on what amounted to a triumphal tour from Syracuse to [[Messina]] and, maybe, on to the island capital, [[Palermo]]. In Syracuse and Messina Caravaggio continued to win prestigious and well-paid commissions. Among other works from this period are ''[[Burial of St. Lucy (Caravaggio)|Burial of St. Lucy]]'', ''[[The Raising of Lazarus - Messina (Caravaggio)|The Raising of Lazarus]]'', and ''[[Adoration of the Shepherds (Caravaggio)|Adoration of the Shepherds]]''. His style continued to evolve, showing now friezes of figures isolated against vast empty backgrounds. &quot;His great Sicilian altarpieces isolate their shadowy, pitifully poor figures in vast areas of darkness; they suggest the desperate fears and frailty of man, and at the same time convey, with a new yet desolate tenderness, the beauty of humility and of the meek, who shall inherit the earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, p.365.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary reports depict a man whose behaviour was becoming increasingly bizarre, sleeping fully armed and in his clothes, ripping up a painting at a slight word of criticism, mocking the local painters.&lt;ref&gt;Caravaggio displayed bizarre behaviour from very early in his career. Mancini describes him as &quot;extremely crazy&quot;, a letter of Del Monte notes his strangeness, and Mario Minniti's 1724 biographer says that Mario left Caravaggio because of his behaviour. The strangeness seems to have increased after Malta. Susinno's early 18th century ''Le vite de' pittori Messinesi'', &quot;Lives of the Painters of Messina&quot;, provides several colourful anecdotes of Caravaggio's erratic behaviour in Sicily, and these are reproduced in modern full-length biographies such as Langdon and Robb. Bellori writes of Caravaggio's &quot;fear&quot; driving him from city to city across the island and finally, &quot;feeling that it was no longer safe to remain&quot;, to Naples. Baglione says Caravaggio was being &quot;chased by his enemy&quot;, but like Bellori does not say who this enemy was.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caravaggio - David con la testa di Golia.jpg|thumb|upright|''David with the Head of Goliath'', 1609–1610, [[Galleria Borghese]], [[Rome]].]]
After only nine months in Sicily, Caravaggio returned to Naples. According to his earliest biographer he was being pursued by enemies while in Sicily and felt it safest to place himself under the protection of the Colonnas until he could secure his pardon from the pope (now [[Paul V]]) and return to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Baglione says that Caravaggio in Naples had &quot;given up all hope of revenge&quot; against his unnamed enemy.&lt;/ref&gt; In Naples he painted ''[[The Denial of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Denial of Saint Peter]]'', a final ''[[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist (Borghese)]]'', and his last picture, ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]''. His style continued to evolve — [[Saint Ursula]] is caught in a moment of highest action and drama, as the arrow fired by the king of the [[Huns]] strikes her in the breast, unlike earlier paintings which had all the immobility of the posed models. The brushwork was much freer and more impressionistic. Had Caravaggio lived, something new would have come.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In Naples an attempt was made on his life, by persons unknown. At first it was reported in Rome that the &quot;famous artist&quot; Caravaggio was dead, but then it was learned that he was alive, but seriously disfigured in the face. He painted a ''[[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid)]]'', showing his own head on a platter, and sent it to de Wignacourt as a plea for forgiveness. Perhaps at this time he painted also a ''[[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio)|David with the Head of Goliath]]'', showing the young David with a strangely sorrowful expression gazing on the severed head of the giant, which is again Caravaggio's. This painting he may have sent to his patron the unscrupulous art-loving Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]], nephew of the pope, who had the power to grant or withhold pardons.&lt;ref&gt;According to a 17th-century writer the painting the head of Goliath is a self-portrait of the artist, while David is ''il suo Caravaggino'', &quot;his little Caravaggio&quot;. This phrase is obscure, but it has been interpreted as meaning either that the boy is a youthful self-portrait, or, more commonly, that this is the Cecco who modelled for the ''Amor Vincit''. The sword-blade carries an abbreviated inscription which has been interpreted as meaning Humility Conquers Pride. Attributed to a date in Caravaggio's late Roman period by Bellori, the recent tendency is to see it as a product on Caravaggio's second Neapolitan period. (See Gash, p.125).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1610 he took a boat northwards to receive the pardon, which seemed imminent thanks to his powerful Roman friends. With him were three last paintings, gifts for Cardinal Scipione.&lt;ref&gt;A letter from the [[Bishop of Caserta]] in Naples to Cardinal Scipione Borghese in Rome, dated 29 July 1610, informs the Cardinal that the Marchesa of Caravaggio is holding two John the Baptists and a Magdalene which were intended for Borghese. These were presumably the price of Caravaggio's pardon from Borghese's uncle, the pope.&lt;/ref&gt; What happened next is the subject of much confusion and conjecture. The bare facts are that on 28 July an anonymous ''avviso'' (private newsletter) from Rome to the ducal court of Urbino reported that Caravaggio was dead. Three days later another ''avviso'' said that he had died of fever on his way from Naples to Rome. A poet friend of the artist later gave 18 July as the date of death, and a recent researcher claims to have discovered a death notice showing that the artist died on that day of a fever in [[Porto Ercole]], near [[Grosseto]] in [[Tuscany]]. Human remains found in a church in Porto Ercole in 2010 are believed to almost certainly belong to Caravaggio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10682743 |title=BBC News - Vatican reveals Caravaggio painting 'found' in Rome |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings come after a year-long investigation using DNA, carbon dating and other analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10333158 |title=BBC News - Church bones 'belong to Caravaggio', researchers say |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that Caravaggio was murdered by the same &quot;enemies&quot; that had been pursuing him since he fled Malta, possibly [[Alof de Wignacourt|Wignacourt]] and/or factions in the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]].&lt;ref&gt;Robb argues this in ''M'' beginning in chapter 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio might have died of [[lead poisoning]]. Bones with high lead levels were recently found in a grave likely to be Caravaggio's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Kington in Rome |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/jun/16/caravaggio-italy-remains-ravenna-art |title=The mystery of Caravaggio's death solved at last – painting killed him &amp;#124; Art and design |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paints used at the time contained high amounts of lead salts. Caravaggio is known to have indulged in violent behavior, as caused by lead poisoning.

==As an artist==

Caravaggio's application of the [[chiaroscuro]] technique shows through on the faces and armour notwithstanding the lack of a visible shaft of light. The figure on the extreme right is a self-portrait.]]

===The birth of Baroque===
Caravaggio &quot;put the oscuro (shadows) into [[chiaroscuro]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Chiaroscuro was practiced long before he came on the scene, but it was Caravaggio who made the technique a dominant stylistic element, darkening the shadows and transfixing the subject in a blinding shaft of light. With this came the acute observation of physical and psychological reality which formed the ground both for his immense popularity and for his frequent problems with his religious commissions. He worked at great speed, from live models, scoring basic guides directly onto the canvas with the end of the brush handle; very few of Caravaggio's drawings appear to have survived, and it is likely that he preferred to work directly on the canvas. The approach was [[anathema]] to the skilled artists of his day, who decried his refusal to work from drawings and to idealise his figures. Yet the models were basic to his realism. Some have been identified, including [[Mario Minniti]] and [[Francesco Boneri]], both fellow artists, Mario appearing as various figures in the early secular works, the young Francesco as a succession of angels, Baptists and Davids in the later canvasses. His female models include [[Portrait of a Courtesan (Caravaggio)|Fillide Melandroni]], [[Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Anna Bianchini]], and Maddalena Antognetti (the &quot;Lena&quot; mentioned in court documents of the &quot;artichoke&quot; case&lt;ref&gt;Much of the documentary evidence for Caravaggio's life in Rome comes from court records; the &quot;artichoke&quot; case refers to an occasion when the artist threw a dish of hot artichokes at a waiter.&lt;/ref&gt; as Caravaggio's concubine), all well-known prostitutes, who appear as female religious figures including the Virgin and various saints.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, ''passim'', makes a fairly exhaustive attempt to identify models and relate them to individual canvases.&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio himself appears in several paintings, his final self-portrait being as the witness on the far right to the ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Caravaggio)|Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Caravaggio's self-portraits run from the ''Sick Bacchus'' at the beginning of his career to the head of Goliath in the ''David with the Head of Goliath'' in Rome's Borghese Gallery. Previous artists had included self-portraits as onlookers to the action, but Caravaggio's innovation was to include himself as a participant.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caravaggio - Cena in Emmaus.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Supper at Emmaus (London) (Caravaggio)|Supper at Emmaus]]'', 1601. Oil on canvas, {{convert|139|x|195|cm|0|abbr=on}}. [[National Gallery, London]].  Caravaggio included himself as the figure on the top left.]]

Caravaggio had a noteworthy ability to express in one scene of unsurpassed vividness the passing of a crucial moment. ''[[Supper at Emmaus (London) (Caravaggio)|The Supper at Emmaus]]'' depicts the recognition of Christ by his disciples: a moment before he is a fellow traveler, mourning the passing of the Messiah, as he never ceases to be to the inn-keeper's eyes, the second after, he is the Saviour.  In ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of St Matthew]]'', the hand of the Saint points to himself as if he were saying &quot;who, me?&quot;, while his eyes, fixed upon the figure of Christ, have already said, &quot;Yes, I will follow you&quot;.  With ''[[The Raising of Lazarus (Caravaggio)|The Resurrection of Lazarus]]'', he goes a step further, giving us a glimpse of the actual physical process of resurrection.  The body of Lazarus is still in the throes of rigor mortis, but his hand, facing and recognizing that of Christ, is alive. Other major Baroque artists would travel the same path, for example [[Bernini]], fascinated with themes from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.

===The ''Caravaggisti''===
The installation of the St. Matthew paintings in the Contarelli Chapel had an immediate impact among the younger artists in Rome, and Caravaggism became the cutting edge for every ambitious young painter. The first Caravaggisti included [[Orazio Gentileschi]] and [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Baglione's Caravaggio phase was short-lived; Caravaggio later accused him of plagiarism and the two were involved in a long feud. Baglione went on to write the first biography of Caravaggio. In the next generation of Caravaggisti there were [[Carlo Saraceni]], [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Orazio Borgianni]]. Gentileschi, despite being considerably older, was the only one of these artists to live much beyond 1620, and ended up as court painter to [[Charles I of England]]. His daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] was also close to Caravaggio, and one of the most gifted of the movement. Yet in Rome and in Italy it was not Caravaggio, but the influence of [[Annibale Carracci]], blending elements from the [[High Renaissance]] and Lombard realism, which ultimately triumphed.

Caravaggio's brief stay in Naples produced a notable school of Neapolitan Caravaggisti, including [[Battistello Caracciolo]] and [[Carlo Sellitto]]. The Caravaggisti movement there ended with a terrible outbreak of plague in 1656, but the Spanish connection – Naples was a possession of Spain – was instrumental in forming the important Spanish branch of his influence.

A group of Catholic artists from [[Utrecht]], the [[Utrecht School|&quot;Utrecht Caravaggisti&quot;]], travelled to Rome as students in the first years of the 17th century and were profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio, as Bellori describes. On their return to the north this trend had a short-lived but influential flowering in the 1620s among painters like [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], [[Andries Both]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]]. In the following generation the effects of Caravaggio, although attenuated, are to be seen in the work of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] (who purchased one of his paintings for the Gonzaga of Mantua and painted a copy of the ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]''), [[Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], and [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], the last of whom presumably saw his work during his various sojourns in Italy.

===Death and rebirth of a reputation===
[[File:Caravaggio - La Deposizione di Cristo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Entombment of Christ]]'', (1602–1603), [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]], [[Rome]].]]

Caravaggio's innovations inspired the Baroque, but the Baroque took the drama of his chiaroscuro without the psychological realism. While he directly influenced the style of the artists mentioned above, and, at a distance, the Frenchmen [[Georges de La Tour]] and [[Simon Vouet]], and the Spaniard [[Giuseppe Ribera]], within a few decades his works were being ascribed to less scandalous artists, or simply overlooked. The Baroque, to which he contributed so much, had evolved, and fashions had changed, but perhaps more pertinently Caravaggio never established a workshop as the Carracci did, and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism which can only be deduced from his surviving work.

Thus his reputation was doubly vulnerable to the critical demolition-jobs done by two of his earliest biographers, [[Giovanni Baglione]], a rival painter with a personal vendetta, and the influential 17th century critic [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], who had not known him but was under the influence of the earlier [[Giovanni Battista Agucchi]] and Bellori's friend [[Poussin]], in preferring the &quot;classical-idealistic&quot; tradition of the [[Bolognese school (painting)|Bolognese school]] led by the Carracci.&lt;ref&gt;Wikkkower, p. 266; also see criticism by fellow Italian [[Vincenzo Carducci]] (living in Spain), who calls Caravaggio an &quot;Antichrist&quot; of painting with &quot;monstrous&quot; talents of deception.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baglione, his first biographer, played a considerable part in creating the legend of Caravaggio's unstable and violent character, as well as his inability to draw.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrow, 608&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, art critic [[Fondazione Roberto Longhi|Roberto Longhi]] brought Caravaggio's name once more to the foreground, and placed him in the European tradition: &quot;[[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]], [[Vermeer]], La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] would have been utterly different&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Longhi, quoted in Lambert, op. cit., p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The influential [[Bernard Berenson]] agreed: &quot;With the exception of [[Michelangelo]], no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berenson, in Lambert, op. cit., p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Only about 80 paintings by Caravaggio have survived, and lost works (or alleged lost works) are found from time to time. One, ''[[The Calling of Saints Peter and Andrew]]'', was recently authenticated and restored; it had been in storage in [[Hampton Court]], mislabeled as a copy. [[Richard Francis Burton]] writes of a &quot;picture of St. Rosario (in the museum of the Grand Duke of Tuscany), showing a circle of thirty men ''turpiter ligati''&quot; which is not known to have survived. The rejected version of ''[[The Inspiration of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Inspiration of Saint Matthew]]'' intended for the [[Contarelli Chapel]] in [[San Luigi dei Francesi]] in [[Rome]] was destroyed during the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]], though black and white photographs of the work exist. In June 2011 it was announced that a previously unknown Caravaggio painting of [[Saint Augustine]] dating to about 1600 had been discovered in a private collection in Britain. Called a &quot;significant discovery&quot;, the painting had never been published and is thought to have been commissioned by [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], a patron of the painter in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unknown Caravaggio painting unearthed in Britain|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/jun/19/unknown-caravaggio-painting-unearthed-britain|author=|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 June 2011|accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio's epitaph was composed by his friend Marzio Milesi. It reads:

&quot;Michelangelo Merisi, son of Fermo di Caravaggio – in painting not equal to a painter, but to Nature itself – died in Port' Ercole – betaking himself hither from Naples – returning to Rome – 15th calend of August – In the year of our Lord 1610 – He lived thirty-six years nine months and twenty days – Marzio Milesi, Jurisconsult – Dedicated this to a friend of extraordinary genius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Inscriptiones et Elogia (Cod.Vat.7927)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1969, two thieves entered the Oratory of San Lorenzo in Palermo, Italy and removed the Caravaggio Nativity from its frame. Experts estimate its value at $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/vc_majorthefts/arttheft/caravaggio |title=FBI — Caravaggio |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Chardin pastel selfportrait.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Self-portrait]],'' 1771, [[pastel]], [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris.]]

'''Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁdɛ̃|lang}}; 2 November 1699 – 6 December 1779) was an 18th-century [[France|French]] [[List of painters|painter]]. He is considered a master of [[still life]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artchive.com/artchive/C/chardin.html Excerpt from Robert Hughes, ''Nothing if not Critical'']&lt;/ref&gt; and is also noted for his [[genre works|genre]] paintings which depict kitchen maids, children, and domestic activities.  Carefully balanced composition, soft diffusion of light, and granular [[impasto]] characterize his work.

==Life==
Chardin was born in [[Paris]], the son of a cabinetmaker, and rarely left the city. He lived on the [[Left Bank]] near [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]] until 1757, when [[Louis XV]] granted him a studio and living quarters in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Chardin/chardin_more.htm Chardin at the Metropolitan Museum of Art] Retrieved on 2007-7-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chardin entered into a marriage contract with Marguerite Saintard in 1723, whom he did not marry until 1731.&lt;ref name=rosenberg179&gt;Rosenberg p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; He served apprenticeships with the history painters [[Pierre-Jacques Cazes]] and [[Noël-Nicolas Coypel]], and in 1724 became a master in the [[Académie de Saint-Luc]].

[[Image:Jean-Baptiste Siméon Chardin 007.jpg|thumb|left|''The Ray'', 1728, [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris.]]

According to one nineteenth-century writer, at a time when it was hard for unknown painters to come to the attention of the Royal Academy, he first found notice by displaying a painting at the &quot;small Corpus Christi&quot; (held eight days after the regular one) on the [[Place Dauphine]] (by the [[Pont Neuf]]). [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo|Van Loo]], passing by in 1720, bought it and later assisted the young painter.&lt;ref&gt;Édouard Fournier, ''Histoire du Pont-Neuf'', 1862, I:300
 By  http://books.google.com/books?dq=intitle:Pont-neuf+inauthor&amp;q=Chardin&amp;pg=PA300&amp;id=w3jG6Xy1rHUC#v=snippet&amp;q=Chardin&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon presentation of ''The Ray'' in 1728, he was admitted to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. The following year he ceded his position in the Académie de Saint-Luc. He made a modest living by &quot;produc[ing] paintings in the various genres at whatever price his customers chose to pay him&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg56&quot;&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and by such work as the restoration of the [[fresco]]es at the Galerie François I at [[Fontainebleau]] in 1731.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 1731 his son Jean-Pierre was baptized, and a daughter, Marguerite-Agnès, was baptized in 1733. In 1735 his wife Marguerite died, and within two years Marguerite-Agnès had died as well.&lt;ref name=rosenberg179/&gt;

[[Image:Jean Siméon Chardin - Retrato de Auguste Gabriel Godefroy.jpg|thumb| ''Boy with a Top'', c.1735, oil on canvas, [[São Paulo Museum of Art]]]]

Beginning in 1737 Chardin exhibited regularly at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]]. He would prove to be a &quot;dedicated academician&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;metmuseum1&quot;&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Chardin/chardin_more.htm Chardin at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; regularly attending meetings for fifty years, and functioning successively as counsellor, treasurer, and secretary, overseeing in 1761 the installation of Salon exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work gained popularity through reproductive engravings of his [[genre works|genre]] paintings (made by artists such as F.-B. Lépicié and P.-L. Sugurue), which brought Chardin income in the form of &quot;what would now be called royalties&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1744 he entered his second marriage, this time to Françoise-Marguerite Pouget. The union brought a substantial improvement in Chardin's financial circumstances. In 1745 a daughter, Angélique-Françoise, was born, but she died in 1746.

In 1752 Chardin was granted a pension of 500 [[livres]] by Louis XV. At the Salon of 1759 he exhibited nine paintings; it was the first Salon to be commented upon by [[Denis Diderot]], who would prove to be a great admirer and public champion of Chardin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, p.182.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1761, his responsibilities on behalf of the Salon, simultaneously arranging the exhibitions and acting as treasurer, resulted in a diminution of productivity in painting, and the showing of 'replicas' of previous works.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg183&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763 his services to the Académie were acknowledged with an extra 200 livres in pension. In 1765 he was unanimously elected associate member of the Académie des Sciences, Belles-Lettres et Arts of Rouen, but there is no evidence that he left Paris to accept the honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg183&quot;/&gt; By 1770 Chardin was the 'Premier peintre du roi', and his pension of 1,400 livres was the highest in the Academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg184&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1772 Chardin's son, also a painter, drowned in [[Venice]], a probable suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg184&quot;/&gt; The artist's last known oil painting was dated 1776; his final Salon participation was in 1779, and featured several pastel studies. Gravely ill by November of that year, he died in Paris on December 6, at the age of 80.

==Work==
[[Image:Jean-Baptiste Siméon Chardin 017.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Woman Cleaning Turnips'', ca. 1738, [[Alte Pinakothek]].]]

Chardin worked very slowly and painted only slightly more than 200 pictures (about four a year) total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morris, Roderick Conway|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/arts/23iht-chardin23.html|title=Chardin's Enchanting and Ageless Moments|date=December 22, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chardin's work had little in common with the [[Rococo]] painting that dominated French art in the 18th century. At a time when history painting was considered the supreme classification for public art, Chardin's subjects of choice were viewed as minor categories.&lt;ref name=&quot;metmuseum1&quot;/&gt; He favored simple yet beautifully textured still lifes, and sensitively handled domestic interiors and [[Genre works|genre paintings]].  Simple, even stark, paintings of common household items (''Still Life with a Smoker's Box'') and an uncanny ability to portray children's innocence in an unsentimental manner (''Boy with a Top'' [right]) nevertheless found an appreciative audience in his time, and account for his timeless appeal.

Largely self-taught, Chardin was greatly influenced by the realism and subject matter of the 17th-century [[Low Countries|Low Country]] masters. Despite his unconventional portrayal of the ascendant [[bourgeoisie]], early support came from patrons in the French [[aristocracy]], including Louis XV. Though his popularity rested initially on paintings of animals and fruit, by the 1730s he introduced kitchen utensils into his work (''The Copper Cistern'', ca.1735, Louvre). Soon figures populated his scenes as well, supposedly in response to a portrait painter who challenged him to take up the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Woman Sealing a Letter'' (ca. 1733), which  may have been his first attempt,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by half-length compositions of children saying grace, as in ''[[Le Bénédicité]]'', and kitchen maids in moments of reflection. These humble scenes deal with simple, everyday activities, yet they also have functioned as a source of documentary information about a level of French society not hitherto considered a worthy subject for painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen_ing/coleccion/obras_ficha_biografia_print207.html# Chardin at the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza] Retrieved 15 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures are noteworthy for their formal structure and pictorial harmony.&lt;ref name=&quot;metmuseum1&quot;/&gt; Chardin has said about painting, &quot;Who said one paints with colors? One ''employs'' colors, but one paints with ''feeling''.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul. ''Art: A New History'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2003, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jean-Baptiste Siméon Chardin 029.jpg|thumb|upright|''Still Life with Glass Flask and Fruit'', c.1728 (note reflected light on glass/silver)]]

Chardin frequently painted replicas of his compositions—especially his genre paintings, nearly all of which exist in multiple versions which in many cases are virtually indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, pp. 68–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with ''The Governess'' (1739, in the [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]]), Chardin shifted his attention from  working-class subjects to slightly more spacious scenes of bourgeois life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, pp. 187 and 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1756 he returned to the subject of the still life. In the 1770s his eyesight weakened and he took to painting in [[pastels]], a medium in which he executed portraits of his wife and himself (see ''Self-portrait'' at top right). His works in pastels are now highly valued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/chardin/ Chardin, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon]&lt;/ref&gt; Chardin's extant paintings, which number about 200,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg56&quot; /&gt; are in many major museums, including the [[Louvre]].

==Influence==
Chardin's influence on the art of the modern era was wide-ranging, and has been well-documented.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Without realizing he was doing it, he rejected his own time and opened the door to modernity&quot;. Rosenberg, cited by Wilkin, Karen, ''[http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/chardin-wilkin-2351 The Splendid Chardin]'', New Criterion. Requires subscription. Retrieved 15 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Édouard Manet]]'s half-length ''Boy Blowing Bubbles'' and the still lifes of [[Paul Cézanne]] are equally indebted to their predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilkin1&quot;&gt;Wilkin.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of [[Henri Matisse]]'s most admired painters; as an art student Matisse made copies of four Chardin paintings in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Unknown Matisse: A Life of Henri Matisse, the Early Years, 1869-1908'', Hilary Spurling, p.86. accessed online July 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaim Soutine]]'s still lifes looked to Chardin for inspiration, as did the paintings of [[Georges Braque]], and later, [[Giorgio Morandi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wilkin1&quot;/&gt; In 1999 [[Lucian Freud]] painted and etched several copies after ''The Young Schoolmistress'' ([[National Gallery, London]]).&lt;ref&gt;Smee, Sebastian, ''Lucian Freud 1996-2005'', illustrated.

The '''Crookes radiometer''', also known as the '''light mill''', consists of an airtight glass bulb, containing a partial [[vacuum]].  Inside are a set of vanes which are mounted on a spindle. The vanes rotate when exposed to light, with faster rotation for more intense light, providing a quantitative measurement of electromagnetic radiation intensity. The reason for the rotation has historically been a cause of much [[scientific debate]].&lt;ref&gt;J Worrall, The pressure of light: The strange case of the vacillating ‘crucial experiment’.

It was invented in 1873 by the chemist [[Sir William Crookes]] as the by-product of some chemical research.  In the course of very accurate quantitative chemical work, he was weighing samples in a partially evacuated chamber to reduce the effect of air currents, and noticed the weighings were disturbed when sunlight shone on the balance.&lt;br&gt;
Investigating this effect, he created the device named after him. It is still manufactured and sold as an educational aid or curiosity.

==General description==
[[File:Radiometer 9965 Nevit.gif|thumbnail|250px|right|A Crookes radiometer in action]]
The [[radiometer]] is made from a glass bulb from which much of the air has been removed to form a partial [[vacuum]].  Inside the bulb, on a low [[friction]] spindle, is a rotor with several (usually four) vertical lightweight metal vanes spaced equally around the axis.&lt;br&gt;
The vanes are:
* polished or white on one side,
* black on the other.
When exposed to [[sunlight]], artificial light, or [[infrared]] radiation (even the heat of a hand nearby can be enough), the vanes turn with no apparent motive power, the dark sides retreating from the radiation source and the light sides advancing.&lt;br&gt;
Cooling the radiometer causes rotation in the opposite direction.

=== Effect observations ===

[[File:General flux diagram.svg|thumb|250px|In partial vacuum pressures the [[photoelectric effect]] of [[radiation pressure]] on the vanes could be explained through the study of '''[[flux]]''' '''F''' through the two '''[[surface]]s''':&lt;br&gt;
the white and the black one.]]The effect begins to be [[observer (physics)|observed]] at partial vacuum pressures of a few [[torr]] (several hundred [[pascals]]), reaches a peak at around 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr (1 pascal) and has disappeared by the time the vacuum reaches 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr (10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; pascal) ([[Crookes radiometer#Explanations for the force on the vanes|see explanations note 1]]). At these very high vacuums the effect of photon [[radiation pressure]] on the vanes can be observed in very sensitive apparatus (see [[Nichols radiometer]]) but this is insufficient to cause rotation.

==Prefix ''radio-'' and suffix ''-meter'' ==
*The [[prefix]] &quot;[[Wikt:radio-|radio-]]&quot; in the title originates from the combining form of Latin ''radius'', a ray: here it's referred to [[electromagnetic radiation]].
*A Crookes radiometer, consistent with the [[suffix]] &quot;[[Wikt:meter|- meter]]&quot; in its title, can provide a quantitative measurement of electromagnetic radiation intensity.
This can be done, for example, by visual means (e.g., a spinning slotted disk, which functions as a simple [[stroboscope]]) without interfering with the measurement itself.

Radiometers are now commonly sold worldwide as a novelty ornament; needing no batteries, but only light to get the vanes to turn. They come in various forms, such as the one pictured, and are often used in [[science museum]]s to illustrate &quot;[[radiation pressure]]&quot; &amp;ndash; a scientific principle that they do not in fact demonstrate.

==Thermodynamic explanation==

===External radiant source motion===
When a [[radiant energy]] source is directed at a Crookes radiometer, the radiometer becomes a [[heat engine]]. The operation of a heat engine is based on a difference in [[temperature]] that is converted to a mechanical output. In this case, the black side of the vane becomes hotter than the other side, as radiant energy from a light source warms the black side by [[black-body absorption]] faster than the silver or white side.  The internal air [[molecule]]s are &quot;heated up&quot; (i.e. experience an increase in their speed) when they touch the black side of the vane.  The details of exactly how this moves the hotter side of the vane forward are given in the [[Crookes_radiometer#Explanations_for_the_force_on_the_vanes|section below]].

The internal temperature rises as the black vanes impart heat to the air molecules, but the molecules are cooled again when they touch the bulb's glass surface, which is at ambient temperature.  This heat loss through the glass keeps the internal bulb temperature steady so that the two sides of the vanes can develop a temperature difference.  The white or silver side of the vanes are slightly warmer than the internal air temperature but cooler than the black side, as some heat conducts through the vane from the black side. The two sides of each vane must be thermally insulated to some degree so that the silver or white side does not immediately reach the temperature of the black side. If the vanes are made of metal, then the black or white paint can be the insulation.  The glass stays much closer to ambient temperature than the temperature reached by the black side of the vanes.  The higher external air pressure helps conduct heat away from the glass.  

The air pressure inside the bulb needs to strike a balance between too low and too high. A strong vacuum inside the bulb does not permit motion, because there are not enough air molecules to cause the air currents that propel the vanes and transfer heat to the outside before both sides of each vane reach thermal equilibrium by heat conduction through the vane material. High inside pressure inhibits motion because the temperature differences are not enough to push the vanes through the higher concentration of air: there is too much air resistance for &quot;eddy currents&quot; to occur, and any slight air movement caused by the temperature difference is damped by the higher pressure before the currents can &quot;wrap around&quot; to the other side.

===Motion without external radiation===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2008}}

When the radiometer is heated in the absence of a light source, it turns in the forward direction (i.e. black sides trailing). If a person's hands are placed around the glass without touching it, the vanes will turn slowly or not at all, but if the glass is touched to warm it quickly, they will turn more noticeably. Directly heated glass gives off enough infrared radiation to turn the vanes, but glass blocks much of the far-infrared radiation from a source of warmth not in contact with it. However, near-infrared and visible light more easily penetrate the glass.

If the glass is cooled quickly in the absence of a strong light source by putting ice on the glass or placing it in the freezer with the door almost closed, it turns backwards (i.e. the silver sides trail). This demonstrates black-body radiation from the black sides of the vanes rather than black-body absorption. The wheel turns backwards because the black sides cool more quickly than the silver sides.

==Explanations for the force on the vanes ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Crookes radiometer]] --&gt;

Over the years, there have been many attempts to explain how a Crookes radiometer works:

#Crookes incorrectly suggested that the force was due to the [[radiation pressure|pressure of light]]. This theory was originally supported by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who had predicted this force. This explanation is still often seen in leaflets packaged with the device. The first experiment to test this theory was done by [[Arthur Schuster]] in 1876, who observed that there was a force on the glass bulb of the Crookes radiometer that was in the opposite direction to the rotation of the vanes. This showed that the force turning the vanes was generated inside the radiometer. If light pressure were the cause of the rotation, then the better the vacuum in the bulb, the less air resistance to movement, and the faster the vanes should spin. In 1901, with a better vacuum pump, [[Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev|Pyotr Lebedev]] showed that in fact, the radiometer only works when there is low pressure gas in the bulb, and the vanes stay motionless in a hard vacuum. Finally, if light pressure were the motive force, the radiometer would spin in the opposite direction, as the [[photon]]s on the shiny side being reflected would deposit more momentum than on the black side where the photons are absorbed. The actual pressure exerted by light is far too small to move these vanes, but can be measured with devices such as the [[Nichols radiometer]].
#Another incorrect theory was that the heat on the dark side was causing the material to outgas, which pushed the radiometer around. This was effectively disproved by both Schuster's and Lebedev's experiments.(Citation needed)
#A partial explanation is that gas [[molecule]]s hitting the warmer side of the vane will pick up some of the heat, bouncing off the vane with increased speed. Giving the molecule this extra boost effectively means that a minute pressure is exerted on the vane. The imbalance of this effect between the warmer black side and the cooler silver side means the net pressure on the vane is equivalent to a push on the black side, and as a result the vanes spin round with the black side trailing. The problem with this idea is that while the faster moving molecules produce more force, they also do a better job of stopping other molecules from reaching the vane, so the net force on the vane should be exactly the same — the greater temperature causes a decrease in local density which results in the same force on both sides. Years after this explanation was dismissed, [[Albert Einstein]] showed that the two pressures do not cancel out exactly at the edges of the vanes because of the temperature difference there. The force predicted by Einstein would be enough to move the vanes, but not fast enough.
#The final piece of the puzzle, [[thermal transpiration]], was theorized by [[Osborne Reynolds]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On certain dimensional properties of matter in the gaseous state&quot; Osborne Reynolds, Royal Society Phil. Trans., Part 2, (1879)&lt;/ref&gt; but first published by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On stresses in rarefied gases arising from inequalities of temperature&quot; James Clerk Maxwell, Royal Society Phil. Trans. (1879)&lt;/ref&gt; in the last paper before his death in 1879.  Reynolds found that if a porous plate is kept hotter on one side than the other, the interactions between gas molecules and the plates are such that gas will flow through from the cooler to the hotter side.  The vanes of a typical Crookes radiometer are not porous, but the space past their edges behaves like the pores in Reynolds's plate.  On average, the gas molecules move from the cold side toward the hot side whenever the pressure ratio is less than the square root of the (absolute) temperature ratio.  The pressure difference causes the vane to move, cold (white) side forward.

Both Einstein's and Reynolds's forces appear to cause a Crookes radiometer to rotate, although it still isn't clear which one is stronger.

==All-black light mill==
To rotate, a light mill does not have to be coated with different colors across each vane. In 2009, researchers at the [[University of Texas, Austin]] created a monocolored light mill which has four curved vanes; each vane forms a convex and a concave surface. The light mill is uniformly coated by gold [[nanocrystals]], which are a strong light absorber. Upon exposure, due to geometric effect, the convex side of the vane receives more photon energy than the concave side does, and subsequently the gas molecules receive more heat from the convex side than from the concave side. At rough vacuum, this [[asymmetry|asymmetric]] heating effect generates a  net gas movement across each vane, from the concave side to the convex side, as shown by the researchers' [[Direct Simulation Monte Carlo]] (DSMC) modeling. The gas movement causes the light mill to rotate with the concave side moving forward, due to [[Newton's Third Law]].
This monocolored design promotes the fabrication of [[micrometer]]- or [[nanomete^Cr]]- scaled light mills, for it is difficult to pattern materials of distinct optical properties within a very narrow, three-dimensional space.

==Nanoscale light mill==
In 2010 researchers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] succeeded in building a [[nanoscale]] light mill that works on an entirely different principle to the Crookes radiometer. A [[swastika]] shaped [[gold]] light mill, only  100 nanometers in diameter, was built and illuminated by laser light that had been tuned to have an angular momentum. The possibility of doing this had been suggested by the Princeton physicist [[Richard Beth]] in 1936. The torque was greatly enhanced by the resonant coupling of the incident light to [[Surface plasmon|plasmonic wave]]s in the gold structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news197555841.html|title=Nano-sized light mill drives micro-sized disk|last=Yarris|first=Lynn|publisher=Physorg|accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cold Chisel''' is a rock band that originated in [[Adelaide]], Australia. It had chart success from the late 70s up until their most recent album releases since 2011, with nine albums making the Australian top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cold Chisel |url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Cold+Chisel |author=|accessdate=28 January 2012 | publisher=''australian-charts.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold Chisel are regarded as having a distinctly Australian popularity and musicianship, exemplifying &quot;[[Australian rock|pub rock]]&quot;.

==Beginnings (1973–78)==
Originally named Orange, the band was formed in [[Adelaide, Australia|Adelaide]] in 1973 as a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] cover band by bassist Les Kaczmarek, keyboard player [[Don Walker (musician)|Don Walker]], [[guitar]]ist [[Ian Moss]] and [[drum]]mer [[Steve Prestwich]]. Seventeen-year-old singer [[Jimmy Barnes]]—known throughout his time with the band as Jim Barnes—joined in December 1973, taking leave from the band in 1975 for a brief stint as [[Bon Scott]]'s replacement in [[Fraternity (band)|Fraternity]].&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, Toby ''Jimmy Barnes: Too Much Ain't Enough'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The group changed its name several times before settling on Cold Chisel in 1974 after writing a song with that title. Barnes' relationship with other band members was volatile; as a Scot he often came to blows with Liverpool-born Prestwich and he left the band several times. During these periods Moss would handle vocals until Barnes returned.

Walker soon emerged as Cold Chisel's primary songwriter. Walker spent 1974 in [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], completing his studies and in 1975 Kaczmarek left the band and was replaced by [[Phil Small]]. Barnes' older brother [[Swanee (singer)|John Swan]] was a member of Cold Chisel around this time, providing backing vocals and [[percussion instrument|percussion]] but after several violent incidents he was fired.&lt;ref name = &quot;bnuzeq&quot;&gt;Creswell&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1976 Cold Chisel relocated to Melbourne but found little success and moved to Sydney in November. Six months later, in May 1977, Barnes announced he was quitting Cold Chisel in order to join Swan in Feather, a hard-rocking blues band that had evolved from an earlier group called [[Blackfeather]]. A farewell performance took place in Sydney that went so well the singer changed his mind and the following month Cold Chisel was picked up by the Warner Music Group.

==Main career (1978–82)==
In the early months of 1978, Cold Chisel recorded its [[Cold Chisel (album)|self-titled debut album]] with producer Peter Walker. All tracks were written by Don Walker except &quot;Juliet&quot;, for which Barnes wrote the melody and Walker the lyrics. ''Cold Chisel'' was released in April and featured appearances from [[harmonica]] player Dave Blight, who would become a regular on-stage guest, and [[saxophonists]] [[Joe Camilleri]] and [[Wilbur Wilde]] from [[Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons]]. The following month the song &quot;[[Khe Sanh (song)|Khe Sanh]]&quot; was released as a single but was deemed too offensive for airplay on commercial radio because of the lyric ''&quot;Their legs were often open/But their minds were always closed&quot;'',&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Noel ''The Australian Encyclopedia of Rock and Pop'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; although it was played regularly on Sydney rock station, [[Double J (radio network)|Double J]], which was not subject to such restrictions because it was part of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]. Despite that setback, it still reached #48 on the Australian singles chart and number four on the Adelaide charts thanks mainly to the band's rising popularity as a touring act and some local radio support in Adelaide where the single was aired in spite of the ban. &quot;Khe Sanh&quot; has since become Cold Chisel's signature tune and arguably its most popular among fans. The song was later remixed, with re-recorded vocals, for inclusion on the international version of 1980's ''[[East (album)|East]]''. 

The band's next release was a live EP titled ''[[You're Thirteen, You're Beautiful, and You're Mine]]'', in November. This had been recorded at a show at Sydney's Regent Theatre in 1977 that had featured [[Midnight Oil]] as one of the support acts. One of the EP's tracks, &quot;Merry Go Round&quot; was later recorded on the follow-up, ''[[Breakfast at Sweethearts]]''. This album was recorded between July 1978 and January 1979 with experienced producer [[Richard Batchens]], who had previously worked with [[Richard Clapton]], [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]] and Blackfeather. Batchens smoothed out many of the band's rough edges and attempted to give their songs a sophisticated sound. This approach has made the album sit a little uncomfortably with the band ever since. Once again, the majority of the songs were penned by Walker, with Barnes collaborating with Walker on the first single &quot;Goodbye (Astrid, Goodbye)&quot; and Moss contributing to &quot;Dresden&quot;. &quot;Goodbye (Astrid, Goodbye)&quot; became a live favourite for the band, and even went on to be performed by [[U2]] during Australian tours in the 1980s.

By now the band stood at the verge of major national success, even without significant radio airplay or support from ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', Australia's most important youth music program at the time. The band had become notorious for its wild behaviour, particularly from Barnes who was rumoured to have had sex with over 1000 women and who was known to consume more than a bottle of [[vodka]] every night during performances.&lt;ref name = &quot;bnuzeq&quot;/&gt;

In late-1979, following their problematic relationship with Batchens, Cold Chisel chose Mark Opitz to produce the next single, &quot;Choirgirl&quot;, a Don Walker composition dealing with a young woman's experience with [[abortion]]. In spite of the controversial subject matter, the track became a hit and paved the way for Cold Chisel's next album. Recorded over two months in early-1980, ''[[East (album)|East]]'' reached #2 on the Australian album charts and was the second-highest selling album by an Australian artist for the year. Despite the continued dominance of Walker, during Cold Chisel's later career all four of the other members began to contribute songs to the band, and this was the first of their albums to feature songwriting contributions from each member of the band. Cold Chisel is the only Australian rock band to score hits with songs written by every member of the group. 

Of the album's 12 tracks, two were written by Barnes, with Moss, Prestwich and Small contributing one song each. The songs ranged from straight ahead rock tracks such as &quot;Standing on the Outside&quot; and &quot;My Turn to Cry&quot; to [[rockabilly]]-flavoured work-outs (&quot;Rising Sun&quot;, written about Barnes' relationship with his girlfriend Jane Mahoney) and pop-laced love songs (&quot;[[My Baby (Cold Chisel song)|My Baby]]&quot;, featuring [[Joe Camilleri]] on saxophone) to a poignant piano ballad about prison life, &quot;Four Walls&quot;. The cover featured Barnes asleep in a bathtub wearing a [[kamikaze]] bandanna in a room littered with junk and was inspired by [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s 1793 painting ''[[The Death of Marat]]''. The Ian Moss-penned &quot;Never Before&quot; was chosen as the first song to air by the ABC's radio station [[Triple J]] when it switched to the [[FM broadcasting|FM]] band that year.

Following the release of ''East'', Cold Chisel embarked on the Youth in Asia Tour, which took its name from a lyric in &quot;Star Hotel&quot;. This tour saw the group play more than 60 shows in 90 days and would form the basis of 1981's double live album ''[[Swingshift]]''.

In April 1981 the band was nominated for all seven of the major awards at the joint ''Countdown''/''[[TV Week]]'' music awards held at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, and won them all. As a protest against the concept of a TV magazine being involved in a music awards ceremony, the band refused to accept its awards and finished the night by performing &quot;My Turn to Cry&quot;. After only one verse and chorus, the band smashed up the set and left the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, Toby and Fabinyi, Martin ''The Real Thing''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Swingshift'' debuted at No. 1 on the Australian album charts, crystallizing the band's status as the biggest-selling act in the country. Overseas, however, Cold Chisel was unable to make an impact. With a slightly different track-listing, ''East'' had been issued in the United States and the band undertook its first (and only) US tour. But while it was popular as a live act, the American arm of their label did little to support the album. According to Barnes biographer [[Toby Creswell]], at one point the band was ushered into an office to listen to the US master only to find it drenched in tape hiss and other ambient noise,&lt;ref name = &quot;bnuzeq&quot;/&gt; making it almost unreleasable. The band was even booed off stage after a lacklustre performance in Dayton, Ohio in May 1981 opening for Ted Nugent, who at the time was touring with his guitar army aka the 'D.C. Hawks'. European audiences were more accepting of the band and the group developed a small but significant fan base in Germany.

In August 1981, the band began work on the album ''[[Circus Animals]]'', again with Opitz producing. The album opened with &quot;[[You Got Nothing I Want]]&quot;, an aggressive Barnes-penned hard rock track that attacked the American industry for its handling of the band. The song would later cause problems for Barnes when he later attempted to break into the US market as a solo performer as senior music executives there continued to hold it against him. Like its predecessor, ''Circus Animals'' contained songs of contrasting styles, with harder-edged tracks like &quot;Bow River&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in place beside more expansive ballads such as &quot;[[Forever Now (Cold Chisel song)|Forever Now]]&quot; and &quot;[[When the War Is Over]]&quot;, both written by Prestwich. The latter track has proved to be the most popular Cold Chisel song for other artists to record -- [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] included a version on the 1989 album ''[[Raging Silence]]'' and [[John Farnham]] has recorded it twice, once while he and Prestwich were members of [[Little River Band]] in the mid-80s and again for his 1990 solo album ''[[Age of Reason (album)|Age of Reason]]''. The song was also a No. 1 hit for former ''[[Australian Idol]]'' contestant [[Cosima De Vito]] in 2004 and was also performed by [[Bobby Flynn]] during that show's 2006 season. &quot;Forever Now&quot; was also covered (as a country waltz) by Australian band [[The Reels]].

To launch the album, the band performed under a circus tent at Wentworth Park in Sydney and toured heavily once more, including a show in Darwin that attracted more than 10 per cent of the city's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creswell, et al&quot;&gt;Creswell, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Break-up and aftermath (1983–84)==
''Circus Animals'' and its three singles, &quot;You Got Nothing I Want&quot;, &quot;[[Forever Now (Cold Chisel song)|Forever Now]]&quot; and &quot;When the War is Over&quot; were all major hits in Australia during 1982 but further success overseas continued to elude the band and cracks began to appear. In early 1983 the band toured Germany but the shows went so badly that in the middle of the tour Walker up-ended his keyboard and stormed off stage during one show and Prestwich was fired. Returning to Australia, Prestwich was replaced by [[Ray Arnott]], formerly of the 1970s progressive rock band Spectrum. After this, Barnes requested a large advance from management. Now married with a young child, exorbitant spending had left him almost broke. His request was refused however because there was a standing arrangement that any advance to one band member had to be paid to all the others. After a meeting on 17 August during which Barnes quit the band it was decided that Cold Chisel would split up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creswell, et al&quot;/&gt; A final concert series known as The Last Stand was planned and a final studio album was also recorded. Prestwich returned for the tour, which began in October. Before the Sydney shows however, Barnes lost his voice and those dates were re-scheduled for December. The band's final performance was at the Sydney Entertainment Centre on 12 December 1983, apparently precisely 10 years since its first live appearance. The Sydney shows formed the basis of the film ''[[The Last Stand (1984 film)|The Last Stand]]'', the biggest-selling concert film of any Australian band. Several other recordings from the tour were used on the 1984 live album ''Barking Spiders Live: 1983'', the title of which was inspired by the name the group occasionally used to play warm-up shows before tours, and as b-sides for a three-CD singles package known as ''Three Big XXX Hits'', issued ahead of the release of the 1994 compilation album, ''[[Teenage Love]]''. 

During breaks in the tour, ''[[Twentieth Century (Cold Chisel album)|Twentieth Century]]'' was recorded. It was a fragmentary process, spread across various studios and sessions as the individual members often refused to work together, but nonetheless successful. Released in February 1984, it reached No. 1 upon release and included the songs &quot;[[Saturday Night (Cold Chisel song)|Saturday Night]]&quot; and &quot;[[Flame Trees]]&quot;, both of which remain radio staples. &quot;Flame Trees&quot;, co-written by Prestwich and Walker, took its title from the BBC series ''[[The Flame Trees of Thika]]'' although it was lyrically inspired by the organist's hometown of [[Grafton, New South Wales]]. Barnes later recorded an acoustic version of the song on his 1993 album ''[[Flesh and Wood]]'' and the track was also covered by [[Sarah Blasko]] in 2006.

Barnes launched a solo career in January 1984 that has produced nine Australian No. 1 albums and an array of hit singles. One of those, &quot;[[Too Much Ain't Enough Love]]&quot; also peaked at No. 1. He has recorded with [[INXS]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Joe Cocker]], John Farnham and a long list of other Australian and international artists and is arguably the country's most popular male rock singer.

Prestwich joined Little River Band in 1984 and appeared on the albums ''[[Playing to Win]]'' and ''No Reins'' before departing in 1986 to join John Farnham's touring band. Walker, Moss and Small all took extended breaks from music. Small, the least prominent member of the band virtually disappeared from the scene for many years, playing in a variety of minor acts. Walker formed Catfish in 1988, ostensibly a solo band with floating membership that included Moss, Charlie Owen and Dave Blight at various times. The music had a distinctly modern jazz aspect and his recordings during this phase attracted little commercial success. During 1989 he wrote several songs for Moss including &quot;Tucker's Daughter&quot; and &quot;Telephone Booth&quot; that the guitarist recorded on his debut solo album ''[[Matchbook (Ian Moss album)|Matchbook]]''. Both the album and &quot;Tucker's Daughter&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the chart in 1989 and won Moss five [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA Awards]]. His other albums met with little success.

==Reunion==
Throughout the '80s and most of the '90s, Cold Chisel was courted to re-form but refused, at one point reportedly turning down an offer of $5 million to play a single show in each of the major Australian state capitals. While Moss and Walker often collaborated on projects, neither would work with Barnes again until Walker wrote &quot;Stone Cold&quot; for the singer's ''[[Heat (Jimmy Barnes album)|Heat]]'' in 1993. The pair then recorded an acoustic version for ''Flesh and Wood'' later the same year. Thanks primarily to continued radio airplay and Barnes' solo success{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}, Cold Chisel's legacy remained solidly intact and by the early 90s the group had surpassed 3 million album sales, most of which had been sold since 1983. The 1991 compilation album ''[[Chisel (album)|Chisel]]'' was re-issued and re-packaged several times, once with the long-deleted 1978 EP as a bonus disc and a second time in 2001 as a double album. The ''Last Stand'' soundtrack album was also finally released in 1992 and in 1994 a complete album of previously unreleased demo and rare live recordings also surfaced. ''[[Teenage Love]]'' spawned a string of hit singles.

Cold Chisel reunited in 1998 to record the album ''[[The Last Wave of Summer]]'' and supported it with a sold-out national concert tour. The album debuted at number one on the Australian album chart. In 2003, the band re-grouped once more for the &quot;Ringside&quot; tour and in 2005 again reunited to perform at a benefit for the victims of the [[Boxing Day tsunami]] at the Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne.

On 10 September 2009, two days after Barnes' 15th studio solo album ''The Rhythm and the Blues'' hit No. 1 on the Australian album charts, Cold Chisel announced it would reform for a one-off performance at the [[Sydney 500]] [[V8 Supercars]] event on 5 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/cold-chisel-reform-for-sydney-telstra-500-v8-supercars-series-at-sydneys-olympic-park/story-e6frewyr-1225771678625|title=Cold Chisel Reform for Sydney Telstra 500 V8 Supercars Series at Olympic Park|last=McCabe|first=Kathy|date=11 September 2009|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reunion saw the band perform at [[ANZ Stadium]] to the largest crowd of its career, with more than 45,000 fans in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anzstadium.com.au/News/LatestNews/NewsArticles.aspx?NewsContentId=1d218436-5943-40ec-9fe7-960ca337c40f|title=Cold Chisel rock race fans|date=5 December 2009|publisher=[[ANZ Stadium]]|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold Chisel played a single live performance in 2010, at the [[Deniliquin]] [[ute muster]] in October. In December Ian Moss confirmed that Cold Chisel was working on new material for an album.

==Death of Steve Prestwich==
In January 2011, Steve Prestwich was diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]]. He underwent surgery on 14 January but never regained consciousness and died two days later, aged 56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/australian-music-industry-in-mourning-over-chisel-sherbet-deaths-20110117-19t4h.html|title=Australian music industry in mourning over Chisel, Sherbet deaths|last=Levy|first=Megan|date=18 January 2011|publisher=The Age|accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catalogue Re-release and Light the Nitro Tour==
All six of Cold Chisel's studio albums were re-released in digitally re-mastered CD versions in mid-2011 and were also made available in digital format. The thirty-date Light the Nitro Tour was announced in July along with the news that former [[Divinyls]] and Catfish drummer [[Charley Drayton]] had been recruited to replace Steve Prestwich. Most shows on the tour sold out within days and new dates were later announced for early 2012. Midway through 2012, [http://www.australiantimes.co.uk/entertainment/music/australian-music/ian-moss-on-cold-chisel-regrets-he-has-a-few.htm they had a  short UK tour], as well as [http://www.australiantimes.co.uk/entertainment/music/australian-music/cold-chisel-to-play-londons-hyde-park-for-hard-rock-calling.htm playing with Soundgarden and Mars Volta at Hard Rock Calling].

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
Influences from blues and early rock n' roll was broadly apparent, fostered by the love of those styles by Moss, Barnes and Walker and Small and Prestwich contributed strong pop sensibilities. This allowed volatile rock songs like &quot;You Got Nothing I Want&quot; and &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; to stand beside thoughtful ballads like &quot;Choirgirl&quot;, pop-flavoured love songs like &quot;My Baby&quot; and caustic political statements like &quot;Star Hotel&quot;, an attack on the late-70s government of [[Malcolm Fraser]], inspired by the [[Star hotel riot|Star Hotel riot]] in [[Newcastle, Australia|Newcastle]]. 

The songs were not overtly political but rather observations of everyday life within Australian society and culture, in which the members with their various backgrounds (Moss was from [[Alice Springs, Australia|Alice Springs]], Walker grew up in rural New South Wales, Barnes and Prestwich were working-class immigrants from the UK) were quite well able to provide. 

Cold Chisel's songs were about distinctly Australian experiences, a factor often cited as a major reason for the band's lack of international appeal. &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Breakfast at Sweethearts&quot; were observations of the urban experience of Sydney's [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] district where Walker lived for many years. &quot;Misfits&quot;, which featured on the b-side to &quot;My Baby&quot;, was about homeless kids in the suburbs surrounding Sydney. Songs like &quot;Shipping Steel&quot; and &quot;Standing on The Outside&quot; were working class anthems and many others featured characters trapped in mundane, everyday existences, yearning for the good times of the past (&quot;Flame Trees&quot;) or for something better from life (&quot;Bow River&quot;).

==Reputation==
Alongside contemporaries like [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]] and [[Midnight Oil]], whose rise to popularity came in their wake, Cold Chisel was renowned as one of the most dynamic live acts of their day and from early in their career concerts routinely became sell-out events. But the band was also famous for its wild lifestyle, particularly the hard-drinking Barnes, who played his role as one of the wild men of Australian rock to the hilt, never seen on stage without at least one bottle of vodka and often so drunk he could barely stand upright. Despite this, by 1982 he was a devoted family man who refused to tour without his wife and daughter. All the other band members were also settled or married; Ian Moss had a long-term relationship with the actress [[Megan Williams (actress)|Megan Williams]] (she even sang on ''Twentieth Century'') whose own public persona could have hardly been more different. Yet it was the band's public image that often saw them compared less favourably with other important acts like [[Midnight Oil]], whose music and politics (while rather more overt) were often similar but whose image and reputation was far more clean-cut. Cold Chisel remained hugely popular however and by the mid-90s had continued to sell records at such a consistent rate they became the first Australian band to achieve higher sales after their split than during their active years{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. While repackages and compilations accounted for much of these sales, 1994's ''Teenage Love'' album of rarities and two of its singles were Top Ten hits and when the group finally reformed in 1998 the resultant album was also a major hit and the follow-up tour sold out almost immediately.

Cold Chisel is one of the few Australian acts (along with [[AC/DC]], The [[Easybeats]],and [[Slim Dusty]]) to have become the subject of a major tribute album. In 2007, ''[[Standing on the Outside (album)|Standing on the Outside: The Songs of Cold Chisel]]'' was released, featuring a collection of the band's songs as performed by artists including [[The Living End]], [[Evermore (band)|Evermore]], [[Something for Kate]], [[Pete Murray]], [[Katie Noonan]], [[You Am I]], [[Paul Kelly (musician)|Paul Kelly]], [[Alex Lloyd]], [[Thirsty Merc]] and [[Ben Lee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
